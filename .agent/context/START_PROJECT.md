# Start Project

This is the single entrypoint for any agent or human.

1) Read the ExecPlan:
   - C:\pt-study-sop\JANUARY_26_PLAN\EXECPLAN_DASHBOARD.md

2) Check current status:
   - C:\pt-study-sop\.agent\context\STATUS.md

3) Review recent history:
   - C:\pt-study-sop\CONTINUITY.md (last 5-10 lines)

4) Pick the next unchecked item in the ExecPlan Progress section.

5) Before editing, write a short plan in:
   - C:\pt-study-sop\.agent\context\logs\daily_log.md

6) After work, update:
   - ExecPlan Progress + Decision Log + Outcomes
   - STATUS.md (current milestone, next step, blockers)
   - CONTINUITY.md (what changed, timestamp)

Notes:
- If you introduce a new decision, record it in the ExecPlan Decision Log.
- Keep changes minimal and scoped.
