## [2026-01-25T23:50] M1 Blocker - Flask Server Not Running

### Problem
Cannot verify M1 Brain ingestion functionality because Flask server is not running.

### Evidence
- User ran `bash scripts/test_brain_ingest.sh` from PowerShell
- All 3 tests returned empty responses (curl gets nothing)
- jq errors are cosmetic (no JSON to parse)
- Confirmed in WSL: no process listening on port 5000

### Impact
- Cannot verify Task 1 diagnosis
- Cannot test Tasks 2-5 (date/semester filters)
- Cannot run pytest tests (require Flask app context)
- Cannot verify frontend changes in browser

### Required Action
**User must start Flask server before we can proceed:**

```powershell
# In PowerShell (keep this running)
cd C:\pt-study-sop
python brain/dashboard_web.py
```

Then in a **new terminal**:
```powershell
cd C:\pt-study-sop
bash scripts/test_brain_ingest_no_jq.sh
```

### Alternative: Proceed Without Verification
If user cannot start Flask now, we can:
1. Implement M1 tasks 2-5 (date/semester filters) based on code analysis
2. User verifies later when Flask is running
3. Fix any issues in a follow-up session

**Waiting for user decision on how to proceed.**

## [2026-01-27T03:15] Tasks 6-7 Blocker - Flask Not Accessible from WSL

### Problem
Tasks 6 and 7 require testing Flask API endpoints, but Flask is running on Windows and not accessible from WSL.

### Evidence
- curl http://localhost:5000/api/sop/index returns "Connection refused"
- Port 5000 not listening in WSL environment
- User confirmed Flask is running (on Windows side)

### Impact
- Cannot verify Task 6: SOP Explorer backend endpoints
- Cannot verify Task 7: SOP Explorer frontend UI

### Workaround
- Skip to Task 8 (implementation work)
- Tasks 6-7 marked as "VERIFY LATER" in plan
- User can verify manually in Windows browser when needed

### Required for Verification
- Open Windows browser: http://localhost:5000/tutor
- Test SOP Explorer manually
- Verify acceptance criteria from plan


## [2026-01-27T03:30] Task 10 - Windows Build Required

### Problem
Task 10 frontend changes complete but require Windows PowerShell build to deploy.

### Changes Made
- Added SyllabusViewTab component (dashboard_rebuild/client/src/components/SyllabusViewTab.tsx)
- Added import to brain.tsx
- Fixed TypeScript error: moduleId -> linkedModuleId
- Commit: bdc23c4f

### Required Action (User)
```powershell
cd C:\pt-study-sop\dashboard_rebuild
npm run build
robocopy dist\public ..\brain\static\dist /E
```

### Impact
- Cannot verify Task 10 in browser until build complete
- Moving to Task 11 (backend work, no build required)
