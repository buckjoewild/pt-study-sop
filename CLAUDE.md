# PT Study System (Trey)

Owner: Trey.

Personal study OS that captures sessions, produces metrics and Anki-ready outputs, keeps Obsidian as the primary knowledge base, and drives improvement via Scholar research. Flask dashboard on port 5000.

Response style: straight to the point, no fluff.

## Environment
- Repo root: C:\pt-study-sop
- Shell: PowerShell
- Obsidian vault: C:\Users\treyt\Desktop\PT School Semester 2

## Core Commands
- Start dashboard: Start_Dashboard.bat
- Run tests: pytest brain/tests/
- Build frontend: cd dashboard_rebuild && npm run build (preferred PM: npm)
- Copy build: copy dashboard_rebuild/dist/public -> brain/static/dist

## Key Paths
- Database: brain/data/pt_study.db
- Session logs: brain/session_logs/
- API: brain/dashboard/api_adapter.py
- Frontend source: dashboard_rebuild/
- Frontend build output: brain/static/dist/
- SOP canon: sop/
- Scholar outputs: scholar/outputs/
- Docs index: docs/README.md (DOCS_INDEX.md also exists)
- Architecture doc: docs/root/PROJECT_ARCHITECTURE.md
- SOP manifest: sop/sop_index.v1.json

## System Modules
- Dashboard, Brain, Calendar (Flask): brain/
- Frontend UI: dashboard_rebuild/
- Scholar research: scholar/
- SOP definitions: sop/
- Tutor logs: brain/session_logs/ (Tutor itself is external)

## UI/UX (Retro Arcade)
- Theme: high-contrast red and black, no glow, consistent across pages.
- Typography: font-arcade headers, font-terminal body.
- Components: 2px solid red borders; semi-transparent black backgrounds.

## Rules
1. Plan before coding for any non-trivial change.
2. dashboard_rebuild is frontend-only; API lives in brain/.
3. Only serve the dashboard via Start_Dashboard.bat on port 5000. Do not run a separate dev server.
4. After frontend changes: rebuild and copy dist/public -> brain/static/dist.
5. Check permissions.json before executing new shell commands.
6. Update CONTINUITY.md after every significant change (append only).
