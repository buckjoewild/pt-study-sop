Goal (incl. success criteria):
- Commit and push all current working-tree changes to main (Scholar proposal fixes + existing dashboard/UX edits), with required checks already run.

Constraints/Assumptions:
- Keep edits minimal and ASCII; follow AGENTS.md.
- Required checks: `python -m pytest brain/tests` and `python scripts/release_check.py` (already run).

Key decisions:
- Include all modified files in the commit (per user choice B).

State:
  - Done:
    - Implemented SLIP-001..SLIP-004 changes (mastery column, M0 interleave step, digest auto-save, data freshness warnings).
    - Tests passed: `python -m pytest brain/tests` and `python scripts/release_check.py`.
    - Committed and pushed all modified files to main; repository clean.
  - Now:
    - None.
  - Next:
    - None.

Open questions (UNCONFIRMED if needed):
