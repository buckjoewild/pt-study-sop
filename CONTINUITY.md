## 2026-02-06 - Safer UI Sync in Start_Dashboard

- Prevent Start_Dashboard.bat from overwriting brain/static/dist with an older dashboard_rebuild/dist/public build.
- When syncing, mirror the build output (robocopy /MIR) so stale hashed assets don't linger.
- Ignore local verification screenshots (_tmp_*.png).

- Add a quick black-screen troubleshooting note to docs/root/GUIDE_USER.md.

## 2026-02-06 - Align Dashboard Build/Run Docs

## 2026-02-06 - Allow Codex CLI in Repo Permissions

- Permit codex exec / codex resume in permissions.json (and .claude/permissions.json) so the codex-subagent workflow isn't blocked by the repo allowlist.

## 2026-02-08 - v9.5 Split-Track + Method Library Merge

- Merged `v9.4-backlog-implementation` into `main` (Composable Method Library: api_methods.py, method_analysis.py, methods page, 4 components, 18 tests, 15-method-library.md, updates to 14 SOP files).
- Bumped remaining `Lite Wrap v9.4` references to v9.5 in 05-session-flow.md, 10-deployment.md, 00-overview.md, and README.md.
- Added `build_custom_instructions()` to `sop/tools/build_runtime_bundle.py` — extracts code block from file 13, writes `sop/runtime/custom_instructions.md`.
- Added `13-custom-gpt-system-instructions.md` to build script required set.
- Regenerated all runtime bundles (6 knowledge files + runtime_prompt.md + custom_instructions.md) at v9.5.

- `BrainChat` now supports `embedded?: boolean` prop (fills parent height, no Card wrapper)

### Concept Map Editor (New Feature)
- Installed `@xyflow/react`, `dagre`, `@types/dagre`, `html-to-image`
