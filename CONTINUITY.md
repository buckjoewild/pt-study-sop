Goal (incl. success criteria):
- Review provided zipped rework of repo to identify missing items vs current repo.
- Success: clear list of missing files/dirs or discrepancies with evidence.
Constraints/Assumptions:
- Need zip file path or location before review.
- Compare against current repo contents; no destructive changes.
Key decisions:
- UNCONFIRMED
State:
  - Done:
    - Read existing CONTINUITY ledger.
  - Now:
    - Await zip file location/details to begin comparison.
  - Next:
    - Inspect zip contents and compare to repo.
    - Report missing items with paths.
Open questions (UNCONFIRMED if needed):
- Where is the zip file located (path)?
- Should comparison be strict file-by-file or focus on key folders only?
Working set (files/ids/commands):
- `CONTINUITY.md`
