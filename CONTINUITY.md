- 2026-01-29: Restored local event color rendering by applying calendarColor inline styles for all events; moved edit modals down to avoid header clipping; rebuilt and synced dashboard.
- 2026-01-29: Limited timezone dropdowns to America zones and added course dropdowns backed by study wheel courses in calendar edit modals; rebuilt and synced dashboard.
- 2026-01-29: Linked study wheel courses to canonical courses (course_id + code), updated course APIs to return canonical IDs, and wired calendar course dropdowns to store courseId/courseCode; restricted timezones to America-only; rebuilt and synced dashboard.
- 2026-01-29: Added course number input for new Study Wheel courses (no retroactive edits); wired to course create API; rebuilt and synced dashboard.
- 2026-01-29: Anchored dashboard dialogs (add/edit course, add deadline, edit task, delete course) to top offset to prevent off-screen modal overlay; rebuilt and synced dashboard.

- 2026-01-29: Fixed Google all-day date shift by parsing date-only values as local dates, added Google event GET for recurring series lookup, and display series recurrence for instances; rebuilt and synced dashboard.
- 2026-01-29: Enriched Google event list responses with master recurrence for instances so Repeat tab shows actual series pattern.
- 2026-01-30: Added Google recurring edit controls (instance vs series), delete instance/series actions, and screen-reader title/description in EventEditModal; wired instance-to-series switch in calendar page; rebuilt and synced dashboard.
- 2026-01-30: Reduced calendar edit modal height and top offset to fit the viewport (local + Google); rebuilt and synced dashboard.
- 2026-01-30: Increased calendar edit modal max height and enabled flex scroll shrink (min-h-0) so inner content fits and scrolls; rebuilt and synced dashboard.
- 2026-01-30: Widened Google edit modal (max-w override with viewport clamp) so synced event forms fit the window; rebuilt and synced dashboard.
- 2026-01-30: Added sop/sop_index.v1.json manifest pointing the Tutor SOP Explorer to sop/library (source of truth).
