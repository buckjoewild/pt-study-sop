Goal (incl. success criteria):
- Restore dashboard header buttons, Notes tab, "Let's Study" text under the brain, and scroll-shrink behavior.
- Confirm/recover any other missing dashboard elements once the UI is reviewed.
Constraints/Assumptions:
- Follow AGENTS.md; keep changes minimal and additive.
- Update CONTINUITY.md each turn.
- Run required checks or note skips: python -m pytest brain/tests, python scripts/release_check.py, manual Run_Brain_All.bat.
- Ask before destructive or irreversible actions.
Key decisions:
- Apply only the Scholar/Ralph dashboard + proposal running sheet + local-state session scripts to main (not unrelated changes).
State:
  - Done:
    - Copied Scholar/Ralph dashboard UI + API + proposal running sheet + local-state session scripts from ralph-readiness into main.
    - Updated opencode launcher default project path to main so session worktrees launch from pt-study-sop.
    - Copied `scripts/launch_codex_session.ps1` into main and updated `C:\Users\treyt\OneDrive\Desktop\LAUNCH_CODEX.bat` to default to main with error handling.
    - Identified a background dashboard server on port 5000 earlier to avoid serving the old header.
    - Restored top nav title text to "TREY'S STUDY SYSTEM" in main dashboard header.
    - Removed Overview/v3.0/TT header elements and added scroll-driven header collapse behavior.
    - Replaced mojibake apostrophes and updated dashboard title to "Trey's Study System".
    - Restarted the dashboard server from `C:\Users\treyt\OneDrive\Desktop\pt-study-sop\brain` to serve updated assets.
    - Cloned `vercel-labs/agent-skills` into `C:\Users\treyt\.codex\skills\agent-skills` (per request).
    - Copied `react-best-practices` to top-level `C:\Users\treyt\.codex\skills\react-best-practices` for direct use.
    - Removed Sync from nav, added a top-right notes toggle + side notes panel, and set logo badge text to "LET'S STUDY".
    - Added notes sidebar JS (localStorage-backed) and updated notes button styling.
    - Added Notes edit button with update-in-place behavior.
    - Reordered nav buttons to Dashboard > Calendar > Brain > Scholar > Tutor on desktop/mobile and updated labels.
  - Now:
    - Removed the mobile hamburger/nav panel markup.
    - Restored main content scale to full size, increased the header title size/position, and pushed the title area lower.
    - Lowered the title underline further and increased top-nav padding to move the title/line down.
    - Removed a stray mobile-only CSS block that was overriding desktop header sizing.
    - Bumped asset query params to force CSS/JS refresh.
    - Removed legacy sidebar/top-nav CSS selectors after audit (unused in current template).
  - Next:
    - Confirm header placement, title size, and main content scale; optionally run required checks.


Open questions (UNCONFIRMED if needed):
- Any other style tweaks needed beyond the header buttons?
