# PT Study SOP v8.2 (High-Speed Refactor)

This release introduces the streamlined High-Speed protocol for PT Study SOP. It removes the prior administrative checks in favor of direct "Prime Directives" and consolidates the previous seven modes down to three core gears: Sprint, Core, and Drill. Use the updated prompts and triage flow to run focused study sessions without bureaucracy.
