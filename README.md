- Release snapshots are frozen copies when present.
- If conflict: Runtime Canon wins.

# PT Study SOP

A structured study system for Doctor of Physical Therapy coursework, powered by the PEIRRO protocol.

## Current Version: 9.1 "Structured Architect + Anatomy Engine" (development tag)

Version numbers track the development state of the SOP. Packaged release bundles may lag behind, and when in doubt the Runtime Canon in `sop/gpt-knowledge/` is the source of truth.

**Master Plan (North Star):** See `sop/MASTER_PLAN_PT_STUDY.md` for the stable vision, invariants, and contracts every release must honor.

---

## Quick Start

**Runtime canon lives in:** `sop/gpt-knowledge/`

1. Open `sop/gpt-knowledge/README.md` for setup instructions
2. From the repo root, run `python brain/db_setup.py` (Brain lives in the root repo; it is **not packaged** inside releases)
3. Copy `GPT-INSTRUCTIONS.md` into your CustomGPT
4. Upload all files from `sop/gpt-knowledge/` to GPT Knowledge (or upload the combined bundle in the same directory)
5. Start studying

**One-click launcher:** Run `Run_Brain_All.bat` (repo root) to sync logs, regenerate resume, start the dashboard server, and open http://127.0.0.1:5000 automatically. Keep the new "PT Study Brain Dashboard" window open while using the site.

**Release preparation:** Before cutting a new release, run `python scripts/release_check.py` and follow `docs/release/RELEASE_PROCESS.md`.

## Core Concepts

| Concept | What It Means |
|---------|---------------|
| **Seed-Lock** | You must provide your own hook/metaphor before moving on |
| **Function Before Structure** | Learn what it DOES before where it IS |
| **Level Gating** | Prove understanding at L2 (teach-back) before advancing |
| **Gated Platter** | If stuck, GPT offers raw metaphor you must personalize |
| **Planning First** | No teaching until target + sources + plan established |
| **Anatomy Order** | Bones -> Landmarks -> Attachments -> OIAN -> Clinical |

---

## Study Modes

| Mode | When to Use |
|------|-------------|
| **Core** | New material, guided learning |
| **Sprint** | Test-first, rapid recall practice |
| **Drill** | Deep practice on specific weakness |

---

## What's New in v9.1

- **Planning Phase (M0):** Mandatory target/sources/plan before teaching
- **Anatomy Engine:** Bone-first protocol with visual landmark recognition
- **Rollback Rule:** Return to landmarks if OIAN struggles
- **Drawing Protocol:** AI-generated drawing instructions for anatomy
- **Condensed GPT Instructions:** Under 8k character limit
- **Packaged Release:** Bundled copies are produced when available; Runtime Canon stays authoritative.
