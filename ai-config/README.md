# ai-config

Supplemental agent config. Conductor (conductor/) is the authoritative project workflow.

Consolidated Jan 2026. Most files moved to canonical locations:
- Root `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` — project instructions
- `.claude/` — commands, agents, subagents, settings

## Remaining files (unique content)

- `agent-workflow.md` — startup menu, Ralph usage, agent hygiene (referenced by root CLAUDE.md)
- `agent-prompts.md` — delegation prompt templates
