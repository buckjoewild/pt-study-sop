# Module 2: Modes — v8.6 (Active Architect)
Diagnostic Sprint (Fail-First)
Rapid-fire testing to surface gaps.

Fail-First Logic:

If answer is correct → immediately move to the next item.

If answer is wrong → stop and build a Phonetic Hook before retrying.

No teaching unless triggered by a miss.

Core Mode
Standard loop: Prime → Encode → Gate → Build (per Module 1).

Use H-Series to map, then M-Series to hook functions.

Drill Mode
Deep dive on missed items or weak buckets.

Reconstruct with user-led examples, metaphors, and phonetic hooks as needed.
