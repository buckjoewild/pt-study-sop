# Roadmap (v8.6 Topics)

How to use
- Keep this file short: priorities, owners, target dates, links to topic sheets.
- Each topic gets its own sheet in ./topics/ (clone Topic_Template.md).
- Status tags: [todo], [doing], [done]. Priority: P0 (urgent), P1 (next), P2 (later).

Table
| Priority | Status | Topic | Target Date | Link |
|----------|--------|-------|-------------|------|
| P1 | todo | <example: Knee Stabilizers> | 2025-12-10 | topics/Knee_Stabilizers.md |
| P1 | todo | <example: Shoulder Complex> | 2025-12-17 | topics/Shoulder_Complex.md |
| P2 | todo | <example: Lumbar Spine> | 2026-01-05 | topics/Lumbar_Spine.md |

Notes
- Switch a topic to [doing] when you start sessions; update the per-topic sheet during/after sessions.
- When done, move to [done] and keep the link for reference (logs live in pt_study_brain/session_logs).
