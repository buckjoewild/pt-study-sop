# Module 6: Framework Library - v8.6 (Active Architect)

## Quick-reference cues (Cheat Sheet)
- H1 (System): System -> Subsystem -> Component
- H2 (Anatomy - opt-in): Structure -> Function -> Behavior
- M2 (Mechanism): Trigger -> Mechanism -> Result
- M6 (Homeostasis): Perturbation -> Correction -> Baseline
- Y1 (Generalist): What is it -> What does it do -> How does it fail
- Levels: L1 (Metaphor) -> L2 (10yo Teach-back) -> L3 (HS) -> L4 (Clinical)
 - Bucket Menu (pick what fits the course/topic; expand with research):
   - Spatial: Region -> Landmark -> Structure
   - Mechanism: Trigger -> Pathway -> Result
   - Compare/Contrast: A vs B -> Shared -> Different -> Use-case
   - Workflow: Step -> Tool/Input -> Output -> Failure point
   - Timeline: Stage -> Key events -> Consequences

Global overrides
- Function -> Structure: always state the job/outcome first, then list the parts that accomplish it.
- Flexibility override (H2): H2 (Traditionalist) is hidden by default. Offer it only when the user explicitly requests Standard Anatomy Order.

H-Series - Priming Tools (Maps)
Purpose: expose structure and parts before memorization.
Usage: use in Step 0 to generate buckets and spatial/structural anchors.
- H1 (The System): System -> Subsystem -> Component -> Element -> Cue
- H2 (The Standard | opt-in): Structure -> Function -> Behavior -> Outcome (opt-in only)

M-Series - Encoding Tools (Logic)
Purpose: convert buckets into functional hooks.
Usage: apply in Step 1+ to define roles, relationships, and mechanisms.
- M2 (The Trigger): Trigger -> Mechanism -> Result -> Implication
- M6 (The Homeostasis): Perturbation -> Stability -> Correction -> Baseline
- M8 (The Diagnosis): Cause -> Mechanism -> Sign -> Test -> Confirmation
- Y1 (The Generalist): What it is -> What it does -> How it fails -> What that looks like

Pedagogy - 4-10-HS-PT levels
- Level 1: Metaphor/Analogy - raw relatable image or comparison.
- Level 2: Simple/Teach a 10-year-old - clear, short, everyday language; user must teach-back before advancing.
- Level 3: High-school - add light terminology, mechanisms, and examples.
- Level 4: Professional/Clinical (PT) - full precision; integrate domain jargon and edge cases.

Pedagogical tools
- Phonetic Bridge: "Break it down. What does this sound like phonetically?"
