# Study SOP (v8.6 "Active Architect")

## Description
The Study SOP encapsulates a versioned MAP → LOOP → WRAP learning framework that prescribes how to start, run, and close study sessions with a strong emphasis on user-supplied seeds, active construction, and guardrails against passive learning. The current v8.6 runtime prompt establishes the operating role, startup checks, and tactical commands so sessions launch consistently regardless of topic, forcing explicit confirmation of focus, mode, and priming actions before any content work begins.【F:current/v8.6/Runtime_Prompt.md†L1-L20】 The master plan document frames the SOP as a production-ready system built around PERRO and Kwik memory techniques, enumerating module coverage, workflow architecture, and gating mechanisms that underpin the core methodology.【F:PT_Study_SOP_Master_Plan.md†L1-L77】【F:PT_Study_SOP_Master_Plan.md†L104-L153】 Modules provide detailed operating instructions; for example, the Core Protocol formalizes the MAP and early LOOP stages by demanding a user seed, running system scans, enforcing phonetic hooks, and escalating explanations through gated levels with mandatory teach-back before clinical depth is permitted.【F:current/v8.6/modules/Module_1_Core_Protocol.md†L1-L37】【F:current/v8.6/modules/Module_1_Core_Protocol.md†L38-L73】 Together, these assets create a repeatable playbook with clear entry conditions, structured execution, and explicit exit criteria.

## Strengths
The SOP shines in clarity of navigation and modularization: the README points to the live version, core files, module set, and logging template, making it easy to load instructions and move through the workflow without hunting for assets.【F:README.md†L1-L23】 The runtime prompt and Core Protocol encode early-session discipline—checking state, confirming scope, and requiring user seeds—before allowing deeper builds, which reduces drift and enforces active participation.【F:current/v8.6/Runtime_Prompt.md†L4-L20】【F:current/v8.6/modules/Module_1_Core_Protocol.md†L6-L26】 Guardrails like gated platters and level unlocks make the escalation path explicit: users must supply metaphors and complete teach-backs before advancing to professional/clinical layers, ensuring comprehension precedes complexity.【F:current/v8.6/modules/Module_1_Core_Protocol.md†L27-L73】 The master plan documents strategic intent, success metrics, and operational priorities, anchoring the SOP in a larger vision that keeps tactical iterations aligned with long-term outcomes.【F:PT_Study_SOP_Master_Plan.md†L104-L153】 Finally, the SOP integrates with the Study Brain through prescribed logging and resume generation steps, promoting continuity across sessions and tools.【F:README.md†L13-L24】

## Weaknesses
Despite its maturity, the SOP retains areas marked incomplete or manual. The master plan notes that LOOP orchestration was merged and still needs timing and spaced-repetition hooks, leaving the mid-cycle control logic partially undefined and reliant on operator judgment rather than scripts or timers.【F:PT_Study_SOP_Master_Plan.md†L18-L30】 Operational priorities remain open—test sprint, dashboard upgrades, and resume template hardening—signaling that real-world validation and instrumentation are pending and that prompt integrity across contexts could still drift without the standardized headers envisioned.【F:PT_Study_SOP_Master_Plan.md†L13-L30】 Execution currently depends on manual copy/paste of prompts and templates; without automation, there is risk of inconsistent initialization or missed steps when fatigue sets in. The SOP also presumes disciplined adherence to the logging template before Brain ingestion, which may fail under time pressure without automated capture or reminders. Finally, the merged Module 3 leaves documentation gaps: operators looking for standalone LOOP orchestration guidance must assemble it from other modules, increasing cognitive load for newcomers.

## Interactions with Study Brain
The SOP is designed to funnel structured session artifacts directly into the Study Brain for persistence and analytics. The README mandates copying the session log template into the Brain’s `session_logs` folder and ingesting it via the ingestion script, making the Brain a required step to close each session.【F:README.md†L13-L24】 Runtime instructions and modules insist on explicit session structure and metadata (mode, gates, teach-backs), which map onto database fields in the Brain and preserve the MAP → LOOP → WRAP narrative for later resumes.【F:current/v8.6/Runtime_Prompt.md†L4-L20】【F:current/v8.6/modules/Module_1_Core_Protocol.md†L6-L37】 In return, the SOP expects dashboards and generated resumes to inform subsequent planning cycles—operators are told to review analytics and load resumes to maintain AI context continuity before launching new sessions.【F:README.md†L13-L24】【F:PT_Study_SOP_Master_Plan.md†L59-L77】 This reciprocal loop—SOP produces structured logs, Brain returns synthesized context and metrics—forms the memory backbone that aims to prevent drift and ensure incremental improvement across sessions.

# Study Brain (SQLite + Analytics Toolkit)

## Description
The Study Brain is a lightweight SQLite-backed storage and analytics system that ingests structured markdown session logs, computes insights, and outputs AI-ready resumes plus dashboards for the SOP. Its README outlines a minimal dependency stack with clear folder boundaries for data, scripts, and log inputs, positioning it as an operational companion to the SOP rather than a standalone app.【F:pt_study_brain/README.md†L1-L55】 The database schema, created via `db_setup.py`, captures session timing, topics, modes, gating events, framework usage, ratings, and free-text reflections with uniqueness constraints and indexes tuned for common queries.【F:pt_study_brain/db_setup.py†L1-L51】 Ingestion is handled by `ingest_session.py`, which parses markdown logs with regex, validates required fields, normalizes values, and persists them with defensive handling of duplicates and missing files.【F:pt_study_brain/ingest_session.py†L1-L115】【F:pt_study_brain/ingest_session.py†L116-L183】 Downstream, `generate_resume.py` loads recent sessions, aggregates modes, frameworks, time, cards, strengths, weaknesses, and issues, then emits markdown summaries for operators to paste into AI chats to rehydrate context.【F:pt_study_brain/generate_resume.py†L1-L113】【F:pt_study_brain/generate_resume.py†L114-L199】

## Strengths
The Brain emphasizes simplicity and reproducibility: setup is a single script with no external dependencies beyond the standard library, making it easy to run on varied environments without containerization.【F:pt_study_brain/README.md†L25-L55】【F:pt_study_brain/db_setup.py†L1-L36】 Its folder layout isolates logs, data, and code, reducing risk of accidental data loss and clarifying operator actions (drop markdown into `session_logs`, run ingest, run resume).【F:pt_study_brain/README.md†L25-L55】 The ingestion script enforces structured data capture through regex validation and explicit error messages, preventing malformed or incomplete logs from corrupting the database and capturing rich context such as frameworks and gate triggers that align with SOP constructs.【F:pt_study_brain/ingest_session.py†L1-L115】【F:pt_study_brain/ingest_session.py†L116-L183】 Resume generation provides actionable rollups—aggregated time, mode distribution, framework frequency, weak/strong areas, and recent topics—packaged as markdown for easy copy/paste into AI prompts, directly serving the SOP’s continuity goals.【F:pt_study_brain/generate_resume.py†L1-L199】 Indexes on date, topic, and mode prepare the database for efficient dashboard queries, and unique constraints guard against duplicate entries, supporting reliable analytics.【F:pt_study_brain/db_setup.py†L13-L36】 Overall, the Brain operationalizes the SOP’s data layer with minimal friction.

## Weaknesses
Reliance on manual markdown parsing introduces fragility: regex extraction can break if operators deviate from the template, and there is no schema migration or field-level validation beyond pattern checks, leaving potential for silent data quality issues when formats evolve.【F:pt_study_brain/ingest_session.py†L1-L115】 The system lacks automated backup or versioning for the SQLite database, so a corrupted file or accidental deletion could wipe historical memory with no recovery plan.【F:pt_study_brain/db_setup.py†L1-L36】 Resume generation operates only on recent sessions and stores output to a single markdown file without provenance; there is no history of past resumes or integration with the SOP files to ensure prompts stay aligned across platforms.【F:pt_study_brain/generate_resume.py†L1-L199】 Dashboard upgrades referenced in the master plan—retention/time-saved charts and gap visualization—are not yet implemented, limiting the depth of analytics available to inform MAP → LOOP → WRAP adjustments.【F:PT_Study_SOP_Master_Plan.md†L13-L30】 Finally, while scripts offer CLI messages, there is no end-to-end automation tying ingestion, resume generation, and dashboard refresh into the SOP cadence, making the loop dependent on user diligence rather than tooling.

## Interactions with Study SOP
The Brain consumes SOP outputs by ingesting session logs crafted from the SOP’s template and structured prompts, encoding MAP → LOOP → WRAP metadata into the database for long-term persistence. The README instructs operators to copy the session log template from the SOP root, place it in `pt_study_brain/session_logs/`, and run the ingestion script, embedding SOP-specific fields like study mode, gated platter triggers, and WRAP reach indicators as first-class data points.【F:README.md†L13-L24】【F:pt_study_brain/README.md†L25-L55】 Conversely, the Brain produces resumes that the SOP expects operators to load at the start of a session to maintain AI context continuity, carrying forward insights on weak areas, strong topics, and recent decisions into the runtime prompt workflow.【F:pt_study_brain/generate_resume.py†L1-L199】【F:README.md†L13-L24】 This creates a feedback cycle: SOP dictates structure and collects reflections; Brain stores, aggregates, and returns synthesized guidance; SOP operators then refine MAP and LOOP strategies based on Brain analytics, closing the loop envisioned in the master plan’s operational priorities.【F:PT_Study_SOP_Master_Plan.md†L13-L30】【F:PT_Study_SOP_Master_Plan.md†L104-L153】 Strengthening automation and dashboard depth would further tighten this interplay, but even in its current state the Brain serves as the memory and analysis layer that keeps SOP sessions coherent over time.
