## Reflection

### What Worked
- Ultra-tiny-step teaching prevented overload.  
- Clear separation of brain lobes and sulci clicked immediately.  
- Ship analogy helped temporarily, then was correctly phased out.  
- Immediate recall cycles were effective even at the 10-second level.

### What Needs Fixing
- Do **not** provide answer cues during tiny checks — confirmed user preference.  
- Models/analogies must not introduce vertical or spatial confusion.  
- Need a later pass to bind lab images to each structure.

### Notes/Insights
- Bucket 1 (Major Brain Regions) is now complete and stable.  
- Student prefers direct, minimal teaching + pure recall for checks.  
- Next session continues with Bucket 2: **Circle of Willis & Brain Arteries**.
