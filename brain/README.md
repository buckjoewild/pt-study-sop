# PT Study Brain v9.3 (Dev)

Session tracking and analytics system for the PT Study SOP.

Brain logs and WRAP activities map to the PEIRRO learning cycle (Prepare, Encode, Refine, Overlearn) for documentation clarity only.

---

## Quick Start

### Initialize Database

```powershell
cd brain
python db_setup.py
```

### After a Study Session

```powershell
# 1. Create log file from template
cp session_logs/TEMPLATE.md session_logs/2025-12-05_topic.md

# 2. Fill in the log with your session data

# 3. Ingest to database
python ingest_session.py session_logs/2025-12-05_topic.md
```

### Before Next Session

```powershell
python generate_resume.py
# Paste output into GPT for context
```

### LLM Intake (optional)

Send plain text or v9.3 JSON directly to the Brain intake endpoint. This logs a session, stores the raw input, and drafts cards when present.

## Dashboard bundle (canonical)
- The Flask app serves `brain/static/dist/index.html` as the one true dashboard.
- Frontend source lives in this repo at `dashboard_rebuild/`.
- Build steps: run `npm run build` in `dashboard_rebuild/`, then mirror-copy `dist/public` into `brain/static/dist`.
- If the frontend breaks, rebuild and re-sync `brain/static/dist` (do not mix assets from other folders).

```powershell
# Plain text
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/brain/chat -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"message\":\"Studied hip joint anatomy for 30 minutes...\"}"

# Direct JSON (tracker + enhanced)
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/brain/chat -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"tracker\":{...},\"enhanced\":{...}}"
```

### Launch Dashboard

```powershell
# One-click launcher (recommended)
../Start_Dashboard.bat
```

### Calendar CLI (add/clear)

```powershell
cd brain
# Quick add with natural language
python calendar_cli.py add "Course: PTA 101 | Lecture Intro to Pelvis | next Tue 7pm"
# Structured prompts
python calendar_cli.py add --interactive
# Clear calendar data (courses, course_events, study_tasks)
python calendar_cli.py clear
```

Notes:
- Quick add accepts `today`, `tomorrow`, `next Tue`, or `YYYY-MM-DD`.
- Use `time:` and `location:` tags when you want those fields.

## Resume Output

The resume generator provides:

- **Readiness Score** (0-100) based on coverage, understanding, confidence
- **Recent Sessions** with ratings and regions
- **Topic Coverage** with freshness indicators (FRESH/FADING/STALE)
- **Anatomy Coverage** by region with landmarks/muscles
- **Weak Areas** needing attention
- **Recommended Focus** for next session

---

## RAG System

The RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system (`rag_notes.py`) provides local-first content indexing:

- **Ingestion**: Ingest markdown notes, textbooks, transcripts, and slides into `rag_docs` table
- **Search**: Full-text search with citation support
- **Source-Lock**: Link documents to courses and topics for constrained retrieval
- **CLI**: Command-line interface for ingest and search operations

Example usage:

```powershell
# Ingest a note
python rag_notes.py ingest session_logs/my_note.md --course-id 1 --topic-tags "anatomy,gluteal"

# Search notes
python rag_notes.py search "gluteal region landmarks" --limit 5
```

## Database Schema (v9.3 + planning/RAG extensions)

Core session logging uses the v9.3 `sessions` table. Key fields include:

- `target_exam` - Exam/block being studied for
- `source_lock` - Materials used in session
- `plan_of_attack` - Session plan
- `region_covered` - Anatomy region
- `landmarks_mastered` - Landmarks learned
- `muscles_attached` - Muscles mapped
- `oian_completed_for` - Full OIAN completed
- `rollback_events` - Whether rollback occurred
- `drawing_used` - Whether drawing was used
- `calibration_check` - Confidence vs actual performance
- `off_source_drift` - Whether you left declared sources
- `source_snippets_used` - Whether source snippets were captured
- `weak_anchors` - Anchors needing cards in WRAP
- `anchors_mastery` - Mastery counts for locked anchors (0-3)

Planning and RAG tables are **additive** and do not change the core session schema:

- `courses` - high-level course metadata (name, code, term, instructor, weekly time budget).
- `course_events` - syllabus events (lectures, readings, quizzes, exams, assignments) with dates, due dates, weight, and raw syllabus text.
- `topics` - conceptual topics tied to courses, with `source_lock`, default frameworks, and optional RAG doc IDs.
- `study_tasks` - concrete study tasks scheduled on specific days, linked to courses, topics, and (once complete) `sessions.id`.
- `rag_docs` - text-normalized RAG documents (notes, textbooks, transcripts, slides) with metadata and content stored locally for retrieval.

Brain remains the **single source of truth** for sessions, planning, and RAG document metadata; higher-level tools (Tutor API, Scholar) read from these tables but do not mutate schema.

## Dashboard Features

The web dashboard (`dashboard_web.py`) provides a modern UI for managing your study system:

### Core Features

- **Stats Dashboard**: View session metrics, time tracking, scores, and analytics
- **Session Management**: Upload session logs via drag-and-drop or quick entry form
- **Resume Generation**: Generate and download AI resume for GPT context
- **Analytics**: Topic coverage, weak/strong areas, study patterns

### Syllabus & Planning

- **Syllabus Intake**:
  - Single event form for quick entry of courses and events
  - Bulk JSON import: Use ChatGPT prompt to format syllabus, then paste JSON
  - **Blackboard Scraper**: Run `python scripts/scrape_blackboard.py` to sync courses, events, and content files directly from Blackboard.
- **Duplicate guard**: Bulk and single imports skip duplicate events for a course; use `python dedupe_course_events.py --apply` to clean existing duplicates if a syllabus was imported twice.
- **Calendar View**:
  - Month-view calendar showing course events, study sessions, and planned spaced repetition
  - Filters by course, event type, and date range
  - Plan spaced repetition sessions directly from calendar
  - Google Calendar two-way sync (Primary + PT School default; configurable calendars)
- **Course Events**: Track lectures, quizzes, exams, assignments with dates, weights, and coverage analytics


Google Calendar sync setup: add credentials under `google_calendar` in `brain/data/api_config.json`, then connect and choose calendars in the dashboard.

### Tutor (Codex-Powered)


- **Tutor Tab**: Chat UI connected to Codex CLI via RAG
- **Mode-Specific Behavior**: Core (teaching), Sprint (testing), Drill (deep practice)
- **RAG Search**: Searches ingested SOP knowledge files with source-lock filtering
- **Citations**: Returns source references for verified answers
- **Unverified Banner**: Marks answers not backed by course materials
- **Card Drafts**: Create flashcard drafts from Tutor interactions

### Scholar Integration

- View Scholar status, toggle safe mode, run orchestrator
- Answer Scholar's design questions
- Track coverage progress
- Readiness status (latest session log and run timestamps) is included in `/api/scholar`
