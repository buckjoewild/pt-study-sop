# Dashboard (Deferred)

This dashboard is **not implemented yet**. See `docs/roadmap/DEFERRED_FEATURES.md` for the current deferment reasons and dependencies.

When work resumes, use this directory for:
- Data access layer and API for session metrics
- UI prototypes (web or app) for progress tracking and insights
- Shared dashboard utilities (e.g., query helpers, visualization config)

Add an architecture outline and initial entry point here (e.g., `app.py` or `frontend/`) once implementation starts.
