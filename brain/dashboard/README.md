# Dashboard (Planned)

Purpose-built space for the upcoming analytics/dashboard experience mentioned in GAP 1. Use this directory for:
- Data access layer and API for session metrics
- UI prototypes (web or app) for progress tracking and insights
- Shared dashboard utilities (e.g., query helpers, visualization config)

When starting dashboard work, add an architecture outline and initial entry point here (e.g., `app.py` or `frontend/`).
