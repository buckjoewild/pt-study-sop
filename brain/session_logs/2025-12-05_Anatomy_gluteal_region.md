## Session Info
- Date: 2025-12-05
- Time: 10:50-11:40
- Duration: 50 minutes
- Study Mode: Core

## Planning Phase
- Target Exam/Block: Module 9 - Gluteal Region & Posterior Thigh
- Source-Lock: Not recorded
- Plan of Attack: Not recorded

## Topic Coverage
- Main Topic: Anatomy - Gluteal Region & Posterior Thigh (bones + deep gluteal muscles)
- Subtopics: Pelvic landmarks (ischial tuberosity, ischial spine, greater trochanter); deep gluteal external rotators (piriformis, superior gemellus, obturator internus, inferior gemellus); sciatic nerve relationship

## Execution Details
- Frameworks Used: H1 System Scan, Visual-First Anatomy Engine
- Gated Platter Triggered: Yes
- WRAP Phase Reached: Yes
- Anki Cards Created: 0

## Anatomy-Specific
- Region Covered: Gluteal region and posterior thigh
- Landmarks Mastered: ischial tuberosity; ischial spine; greater trochanter; pelvic map flag shape
- Muscles Attached: piriformis; superior gemellus; obturator internus tendon; inferior gemellus
- OIAN Completed For: None
- Rollback Events: No
- Drawing Used: Not recorded
- Drawings Completed: Not recorded

## Ratings (1-5 scale)
- Understanding Level: 5
- Retention Confidence: 4
- System Performance: 4
- Calibration Check: Not recorded

## Anchors Locked
1. Ischial tuberosity - "elephant nose at the bottom of the left hip bone."
2. Ischial spine - "little tooth above the tuberosity."
3. Greater trochanter - "lateral delt muscle sitting outside the pelvis."
4. Pelvic map shape - "flag shape."
5. Piriformis - "runs above the sciatic nerve."
6. Superior gemellus - "feather piece under piriformis."
7. Obturator internus tendon - "marbling in a ribeye."
8. Inferior gemellus - "other outside portion of the feather; OI tendon is the middle of the feather."

## Reflection

### What Worked
The slow breakdown, layering landmarks + muscles + relationships. Visual anchoring worked very well. The system referenced your own words effectively.

### What Needs Fixing
Start with images immediately in the next sessions. Visual-first must be enforced from the first step.

### Gaps Identified
Not recorded.

### Notes/Insights
Deep gluteal region is now visually locked. Landmark anchoring greatly improved recognition of piriformis and gemelli. Next steps will build smoothly off this.

## Next Session Priority
- Topic: Finish Module 9 neurovascular
- Focus: Begin with lab slide checklist; reinforce superior/inferior gluteal nerves & arteries
- Materials Needed: Module 9 lab images; checklist; optional drawing tools
