# Session Log - 2025-12-05

## Session Info
- Date: 2025-12-05
- Time: 18:49-20:49 (evening)
- Duration: 120 minutes
- Study Mode: Sprint

## Planning Phase
- Target Exam/Block: Module 9 - Gluteal Region & Posterior Thigh
- Source-Lock: Module 9 lab PDF + written MCQ set
- Plan of Attack: Sprint MCQ + lab practical anchors; patch pes anserinus miss; finish wrap

## Topic Coverage
- Main Topic: Anatomy - Gluteal Region & Posterior Thigh (wrap sprint + lab)
- Subtopics: deep gluteal vessels and nerves; pes anserinus; hamstring group; popliteal fossa vessels; written O/I/N/A targets

## Execution Details
- Frameworks Used: Visual-First Anatomy Engine; Sprint Mode (MCQ); M4 Build
- Gated Platter Triggered: Yes (pes anserinus miss)
- WRAP Phase Reached: Yes
- Anki Cards Created: 0

## Anatomy-Specific
- Region Covered: Gluteal region, posterior thigh, popliteal fossa
- Landmarks Mastered: popliteal fossa borders; BF tendon lateral edge; semimembranosus bed; semitendinosus rope; pes anserinus
- Muscles Attached: semimembranosus; semitendinosus; biceps femoris long head; biceps femoris short head; adductor magnus
- OIAN Completed For: Not recorded
- Rollback Events: No
- Drawing Used: Not recorded
- Drawings Completed: Not recorded

## Ratings (1-5 scale)
- Understanding Level: 3
- Retention Confidence: 3
- System Performance: 2
- Calibration Check: Not recorded

## Anchors Locked

### Written Exam Structures
- Piriformis = divider (above/below piriformis = superior vs inferior gluteal vessels)
- Superior gluteal nerve/artery = thin yellow root + red root running superolateral above piriformis
- Inferior gluteal nerve/artery = below piriformis + glute max
- Posterior femoral cutaneous nerve = “snake tongue” sensory nerve of posterior thigh
- Sciatic = “big tongue”

### Lab Practical Structures
- Semimembranosus = “bed the semitendinosus lays in”
- Semitendinosus = “long rope tendon”
- Biceps femoris long head = “ridge of outer hamstring”
- Biceps femoris short head = “piece of bacon tucked under ridge”
- Adductor magnus = “hamstring cover”
- Popliteal fossa = “diamond behind the upper knee”
- Popliteal artery = “light pipe deep in diamond”
- Popliteal vein = “dark pipe beside artery”
- BF tendon = “painted white wall at lateral diamond edge”

### Phonetic Anchors
- Pes anserinus = “ANSWER this + semitendinosus”

## Reflection

### What Worked
- Visual anchors were clear, strong, and very memorable.
- Sprint-Mode MCQ format helped identify misconceptions quickly.
- Lab-only purifying step ensured you now know exactly what structures are required for the practical.

### What Needs Fixing
- Drawing instructions were not broken into small enough steps—needs correction next session.
- Oversight on written exam O/I patterns—origins/insertions were underweighted until reviewing practice questions.
- Brief drift during the quiz; need clearer Source-Lock between lab vs written materials.

### Gaps Identified
- Written O/I/N/A quick sheet still needed for Module 9.
- Need refined micro-step drawing routine for deep gluteal region.

### Notes/Insights
- Exam is hybrid: lab = pure identification from Module 9 lab PDF; written = targeted O/I/N/A facts.
- Sprint Mode caught and corrected the pes anserinus miss.
- Near-complete mastery of Module 9 after this wrap sprint.

## Next Session Priority
- Topic: Finish Module 9 neurovascular and O/I/N/A quick sheet
- Focus: Redo deep gluteal drawing with micro-steps; generate Module 9 mini O/I/N/A sheet; finish mock exam questions
- Materials Needed: Module 9 lab images; written MCQ set; drawing tools; O/I/N/A reference list
