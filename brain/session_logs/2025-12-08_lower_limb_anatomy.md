# Session Log - 2025-12-08

## Session Info
- Date: 2025-12-08
- Time: --
- Duration: 300 minutes (approx. 5 hours)
- Study Mode: Core

## Planning Phase
- Target Exam/Block: Exam 3 - Lower Limb and Foot
- Source-Lock: Week 10 LO list; anterior/medial thigh slides; leg & foot slides; transcripts (anterior/medial thigh + leg/foot); sample questions (lower leg + exam 3)
- Plan of Attack:
  1) Thigh compartments + femoral triangle/adductor canal
  2) Leg compartments (ant/lat/post)
  3) Foot bones + joints + arches
  4) Plantar layers 1-4 (small steps)
  5) Recall gates throughout

## Topic Coverage
- Main Topic: Lower Limb Anatomy - Module 10
- Subtopics: anterior thigh, medial thigh, femoral triangle, adductor canal, anterior leg, lateral leg, superficial posterior leg, deep posterior leg, foot bones, foot joints, foot arches, plantar layers 1-4

## Execution Details

## Reflection

### What Worked
- The images helped.
- Still trying to figure out how to study anatomy effectively.

### What Needs Fixing
- Need to add a way to mind map.
- Need to add the "Compartment-Nerve-Action Map" to the SOP.
- Need images automatically when explaining anatomy.
- Need to reinforce the 1-step rule in M4 Build within Core Mode.

### Gaps Identified
- Need a system for consistently handling images and small-step gating in anatomy.

### Notes/Insights
- The Anatomy Engine helped organize lower limb content once the pace was slowed.

## Next Session Priority
- Topic: Anatomy Week 11 - Face
- Focus: Start with bones -> landmarks -> attachments (Anatomy Engine)
- Materials Needed: Week 11 LO list, slides, transcripts, sample questions
