# Session Log - 2025-12-08

## Session Info
- Date: 2025-12-08
- Time: 18:00-22:20
- Duration: 260 minutes
- Study Mode: Core

## Planning Phase
- Target Exam/Block: Week 11 Facial Expression Muscles
- Source-Lock: Week 11 slide deck + SOP M3 encode steps
- Plan of Attack: Encode facial expression muscles using SOP-compliant M3 Encode with Jim Kwik sound-function-image lock; enforce seed-lock and one-step gating.

## Topic Coverage
- Main Topic: Face Encoding — Week 11 Facial Expression Muscles
- Subtopics: Zygomaticus Major; Orbicularis Oculi (orbital); Orbicularis Oculi (palpebral); Orbicularis Oris; Risorius; Buccinator; Levator Labii Superioris; Frontalis; Corrugator Supercilii; Procerus

## Execution Details
- Frameworks Used: M3 Encode; Jim Kwik Sound→Function→Image→Lock
- Gated Platter Triggered: Yes
- WRAP Phase Reached: No
- Anki Cards Created: 10
- Off-source drift? (Y/N): N
- Source snippets used? (Y/N): Y

## Anatomy-Specific (if applicable)
- Region Covered: Face — expression musculature
- Landmarks Mastered: NA
- Muscles Attached: NA
- OIAN Completed For: Zygomaticus Major; Orbicularis Oculi (orbital); Orbicularis Oculi (palpebral); Orbicularis Oris; Risorius; Buccinator; Levator Labii Superioris; Frontalis; Corrugator Supercilii; Procerus
- Rollback Events: No
- Drawing Used: No
- Drawings Completed: 

## Ratings (1-5 scale)
- Understanding Level: 4
- Retention Confidence: 4
- System Performance: 4
- Calibration Check: Well-calibrated; Orbicularis Oris fixed during session

## Anchors Locked
1. Zygomaticus Major: big smile elevator hook
2. Orbicularis Oculi (orbital): tight eye closure ring
3. Orbicularis Oculi (palpebral): gentle blink curtain
4. Orbicularis Oris: lip seal/pucker lock
5. Risorius: lateral grin pull string
6. Buccinator: cheek compressor bellows
7. Levator Labii Superioris: upper lip lifter lever
8. Frontalis: eyebrow elevator lift
9. Corrugator Supercilii: brow knit vertical wrinkle
10. Procerus: nose scrunch disgust crease

## Weak Anchors (for WRAP cards)
- None noted; prior Orbicularis Oris weakness corrected.

## Reflection

### What Worked
- Added “word + meaning together” before imagery to improve hook quality and alignment.
- Fully integrated Jim Kwik method (Sound→Function→Image→Lock) matching M3 dual code.
- Enforced one-step gating with user confirmation (sound, function, image, resonance, lock).
- Function-first flow prevented drift; resonance checks ensured hooks feel right.

### What Needs Fixing
- Need to encode remaining Week 11 muscles and supporting structures (masticators, TMJ, CN VII branches, facial arteries).

### Gaps Identified
- Remaining Week 11 facial muscles (Nasalis, LLSAN, Zygomaticus minor, Levator anguli oris, Depressor anguli oris, Depressor labii inferioris, Mentalis, Platysma).
- Mastication muscles (Masseter, Temporalis, Medial/Lateral pterygoid) and TMJ anatomy/ligaments/motion.
- CN VII branches (Temporal, Zygomatic, Buccal, Mandibular, Cervical; stylomastoid foramen + parotid).
- Face arteries (facial artery path, maxillary branches, ECA superficial branches).

### Notes/Insights
- Accuracy today ~90%; only weak point was Orbicularis Oris, now repaired.
- “Name + meaning together” step drastically improves imagery resonance.

## Next Session Priority
- Topic: Finish Week 11 facial musculature and associated systems
- Focus: Remaining facial muscles → mastication muscles → TMJ mechanics → CN VII branches → facial arteries
- Materials Needed: Week 11 muscle list; TMJ diagrams; CN VII pathway references; vascular pathways
