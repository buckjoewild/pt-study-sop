# Session Log - 2025-12-10

## Session Info
- Date: 2025-12-10
- Time: 08:00
- Duration: 600 minutes
- Study Mode: Core

## Planning Phase
- Target Exam/Block: Final Exam — Anatomy (Dr. Ko)
- Source-Lock: Study Checklist for Exam 3; Dr. Ko lecture transcripts (Neuro, Foot, Lower Limb, Neck); lab images (orientation only); PowerPoint diagrams (foramina, Circle of Willis, neck); rule: only facts present in Dr. Ko’s materials
- Plan of Attack: 1) Run full Extraction-Mode on all exam topics with Tree Maps; 2) Convert Tree Maps → teach-back (adult + 10-year-old) per group; 3) Sprint tests with immediate correction; 4) Generate Anki decks + cram sheets; 5) Capture weak points and finalize morning-of review plan

## Topic Coverage
- Main Topic: Comprehensive Anatomy exam prep (Dr. Ko)
- Subtopics: Cranial nerves & foramina; Circle of Willis; lower limb vessels/muscles; foot layers L1–L4; gluteal & thigh regions; neck/ansa cervicalis; dural sinuses; ankle ligaments; plantar arteries; popliteal branches; greater trochanter/ischial tuberosity attachments; femoral triangle; adductor canal; smile muscles; maxillary artery branches; brainstem + CN relationships

## Execution Details
- Frameworks Used: Extraction-Mode; Tree Maps; Teach → ELI10 → ELI4 ladder; Sprint/Drill loops; Weak-point tracker; Image_group anchors
- Gated Platter Triggered: No
- WRAP Phase Reached: Yes
- Anki Cards Created: 120 (full 20-topic deck + weak-point drills)
- Off-source drift? (Y/N): No
- Source snippets used? (Y/N): Yes

## Anatomy-Specific (if applicable)
- Region Covered: Gluteal region; posterior/anterior/medial thigh; lower leg; foot (layers 1–4); head & neck (cranial base, Circle of Willis, dural sinuses)
- Landmarks Mastered: Greater trochanter attachment map; ischial tuberosity attachment map; femoral triangle borders; adductor canal borders; plantar surface layers; skull base foramina
- Muscles Attached: Gluteus maximus/medius/minimus; hamstrings; obturators; piriformis; quadratus femoris; foot layer muscles (FDB, AbH, AbDM, QP, lumbricals, interossei)
- OIAN Completed For: Gluteal group; posterior/anterior/medial thigh groups; foot intrinsic muscles layer 1–4; smile muscles; select neck muscles tied to ansa cervicalis
- Rollback Events: No
- Drawing Used: Yes (foramina table; Circle of Willis; foot layers; skull base)
- Drawings Completed: Foramina table; Circle of Willis flow map; foot layer stack; ankle ligament schematic

## Ratings (1-5 scale)
- Understanding Level: 4
- Retention Confidence: 4
- System Performance: 5
- Calibration Check: Well-calibrated

## Anchors Locked
1. Cranial nerves → "Train line through skull base" (stations = foramina)
2. Circle of Willis → "Hexagonal roundabout with detours blocked" (PCOM/ACOM as ramps)
3. Foot layers → "4-story parking garage" (tendons as ramps, vessels as elevators)
4. Greater trochanter → "Gear hub for external rotators"
5. Ansa cervicalis → "Neck harness looping around carotid sheath"

## Weak Anchors (for WRAP cards)
- Foramen spinosum → middle meningeal artery (name-location lock)
- Sigmoid sinus → internal jugular vein (continuity)
- CN VII & VIII → internal acoustic meatus (paired exit)
- Deep plantar artery origin (dorsalis pedis) and path
- ATFL as most commonly sprained ligament
- Quadratus plantae innervation (lateral plantar nerve)

## Reflection

### What Worked
- Strict Extraction-Mode before teaching prevented invented details; Tree Maps kept scope clear
- Sprint loops with immediate correction tightened weak spots quickly
- Image_group anchors boosted recall for foramina and foot layers
- Anki CSV generated during session ensured spaced repetition coverage

### What Needs Fixing
- Need faster recall on a few cranial nerve–foramen pairs and plantar artery branching
- Still smoothing muscle-to-landmark recall for lesser-known attachments

### Gaps Identified
- Precision on deep plantar artery course and deltoid ligament components under time pressure
- Need one more pass on PCA/SCA relationship to CN III

### Notes/Insights
- Grouping topics into four clusters (glute/post thigh, ant/med thigh, leg/foot, head/neck) kept load manageable
- No off-source drift; adhering to Dr. Ko-only facts improved confidence in exam alignment

## Next Session Priority
- Topic: Final exam polish (Dr. Ko Anatomy)
- Focus: Redraw foramina table; redraw Circle of Willis; quick review foot layers L1–L2 and ankle ligaments (ATFL); fast Anki pass of weak anchors
- Materials Needed: Dr. Ko diagrams for skull base & Circle of Willis; foot layer diagrams; Anki deck; weak-point list
