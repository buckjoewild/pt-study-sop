# Session Log - 2025-12-11

## Session Info
- Date: 2025-12-11
- Time: ~ (user-initiated; not captured)
- Duration: 165
- Study Mode: Core
- Execution Engine: Clin-Path v8 workflow applied to geriatrics

## Planning Phase
- Target Exam/Block: Lifespan Exam 3 — Geriatrics
- Source-Lock: Normal vs Commonly Abnormal PPT; Lifespan SoftChalk Geriatrics Module; instructor learning objectives
- Plan of Attack:
  1) System-by-system slide-only teaching
  2) Micro-step L2 gating (teach -> explain -> lock)
  3) PT decision logic integration
  4) Exam-level Sprint quizzes
  5) Wrap + Anki generation

## Topic Coverage
- Main Topic: Normal vs Commonly Abnormal Aging
- Subtopics:
  - Physiologic Stress & Homeostasis
  - Cardiovascular & Autonomic Response
  - Gait & Functional Mobility
  - Function & Independence

## Execution Details
- Frameworks Used: H7 Narrative; M2 Trigger -> Mechanism -> Result; M8 Cause -> Sign -> Test; L2 gating enforced; Sprint Mode (exam-level MCQs)
- Gated Platter Triggered: No (AI-led due to zero prior exposure)
- WRAP Phase Reached: Yes
- Anki Cards Created: 15 (core concepts, decision rules, exam traps; CSV front/back; source-faithful)
- Off-source drift? (Y/N): No
- Source snippets used? (Y/N): Yes
  - Homeostasis window / homeostenosis
  - Conservative geriatric gait characteristics
  - Functional red flags list
  - Gait speed cutoffs
  - 150 ft / 1/4 mile thresholds
  - Floor transfer significance
  - Orthostatic BP monitoring guidance

## Anatomy-Specific (if applicable)
- Region Covered: N/A
- Landmarks Mastered: N/A
- Muscles Attached: N/A
- OIAN Completed For: N/A
- Rollback Events: N/A
- Drawing Used: N/A
- Drawings Completed: N/A

## Ratings (1-5 scale)
- Understanding Level: 5
- Retention Confidence: 4
- System Performance: 4.5 (early correction -> strong finish)
- Calibration Check: Good (minor over-reliance on mechanism vs trigger corrected in Sprint)

## Anchors Locked
1. Homeostasis window = safe operating zone that shrinks with age
2. Stress responses linger; recovery is the risk
3. PTs control stress and monitor recovery, not just performance
4. Transitions (repositioning) are high-risk
5. Conservative gait != safe gait
6. Gait speed = global function
7. Functional red flags = loss of adaptability
8. Independence screens: 150 ft, 1/4 mile, floor transfers
9. Activity avoidance = early decline signal

## Weak Anchors (for WRAP cards)
- Trigger vs mechanism in exam questions (corrected)
- Assistive device indication vs appearance (corrected)

## Reflection

### What Worked
- Extremely slow, micro-step teaching with L2 teach-back before terminology
- Slide-only enforcement increased trust
- Sprint quizzes immediately after consolidation

### What Needs Fixing
- Clarify "AI teaches first" earlier in Core Mode
- Keep strict separation of mechanism vs action on exams

### Gaps Identified
- None flagged; topic considered complete for exam scope

### Notes/Insights
- Topic is exam-ready; future reviews should be Sprint/Drill only

## Next Session Priority
- Topic: Optimizing Environments for Aging in Place (20%)
- Focus: Home safety, least restrictive environment, PT decision logic
- Materials Needed: Environment/Aging in Place PPT; assigned readings for that lecture only
- Recommended Mode: Core (shorter) then Sprint
