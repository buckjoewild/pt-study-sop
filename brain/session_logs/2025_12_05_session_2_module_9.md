## Anchors Locked
1. **Quadratus femoris** — "looks like a square"  
2. **Sciatic nerve** — "a big tongue coming out between piriformis and superior gemellus"  
3. **Posterior femoral cutaneous nerve** — "a smaller tongue that splits into two like a snake tongue"  

## Ratings

- **Understanding:** —  
- **Retention Confidence:** —  
- **System Performance:** —  

## Reflection
### What Worked
- Staying locked to **your exact lab images** (no outside cadavers).  
- Visual-first study of Module 9 deep gluteals + nerves.  
- Your personal anchors (tongue, snake-tongue, square) improved recognition instantly.  

### What Needs Fixing
- Next session: begin with a clean LAB slide checklist so no time is lost.  
- Transition sooner to superior/inferior gluteal nerves & arteries to complete module.  

### Notes/Insights
- You now have 100% mastery of the **core deep gluteal stack** and **primary nerves** used on the practical exam.  
- Only a few structures remain to complete Module 9 lab images (nerve to OI, nerve to QF, sup/inf gluteal N/A).  
- Written exam strategy now clear thanks to practice-question review.
