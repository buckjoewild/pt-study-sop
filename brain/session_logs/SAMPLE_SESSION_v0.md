# Session Log - 2025-03-12

## Session Info
- Date: 2025-03-12
- Time: 14:00
- Duration: 45 minutes
- Study Mode: Core

## Planning Phase
- Target Exam/Block: Anatomy Final - Lower Limb
- Source-Lock: Lab PDF p.2-6; Hip slides; LO list
- Plan of Attack: 1) Confirm gait stance-phase steps; 2) Map hip extensor roles; 3) Run KWIK hooks for each muscle; 4) PERRO recap.

## Topic Coverage
- Main Topic: Hip extensors synergy and gait cycle integration
- Subtopics: Gluteus maximus vs hamstrings timing, stance-phase checkpoints, pelvic stability cues

## Execution Details
- Frameworks Used: H1, M2
- SOP Modules Used: M0,M1,M2,M3,M6
- Engines Used: Anatomy Engine
- Core Learning Modules Used: PERRO, KWIK
- Gated Platter Triggered: No
- WRAP Phase Reached: Yes
- Anki Cards Created: 3
- Off-source drift? (Y/N): N
- Source snippets used? (Y/N): Y
- Prompt Drift? (Y/N): Y
- Prompt Drift Notes: Model started teaching before planning confirmation; corrected after reminder.

## Anatomy-Specific (if applicable)
- Region Covered: Posterior Hip
- Landmarks Mastered: PSIS, greater trochanter, ischial tuberosity
- Muscles Attached: Gluteus maximus, semitendinosus, semimembranosus, biceps femoris long head
- OIAN Completed For: Gluteus maximus, semitendinosus, semimembranosus
- Rollback Events: No
- Drawing Used: Yes
- Drawings Completed: Layered posterior hip landmarks with muscle overlay

## Ratings (1-5 scale)
- Understanding Level: 4
- Retention Confidence: 4
- System Performance: 4
- Calibration Check: Well-calibrated

## Anchors Locked
1. Stance-phase checklist: heel strike → foot flat → mid-stance → terminal stance → pre-swing
2. Hip extensors as "posterior brake pads" preventing anterior tilt at heel strike
3. Glute max firing burst tied to heel strike; hamstrings sustain through mid-stance
4. KWIK hook: ischial tuberosity = "seat post" for hamstring anchoring
5. PSIS-to-GT line marks glute max fiber sweep

## Weak Anchors (for WRAP cards)
- Weak anchor: Pelvic drop counterforce details because cues felt fuzzy; needs card in WRAP.
- Weak anchor: Distinguishing semitendinosus vs semimembranosus actions during gait; needs card in WRAP.

## Reflection

### What Worked
- Using PERRO to restate the stance-phase checklist anchored the muscle timing sequence.
- KWIK hooks for landmarks sped up drawing recall.

### What Needs Fixing
- Add explicit pause for plan confirmation after the WRAP checklist to avoid rework.
- Need quicker toggle back to source-lock when new questions appear mid-stance review.

### Gaps Identified
- Pelvic stability vs lumbar compensation during terminal stance.

### Notes/Insights
- Drawing the PSIS-to-GT line first reduced redrawing time for muscle overlays.

## Next Session Priority
- Topic: Pelvic stability control during terminal stance
- Focus: Clarify glute max vs hamstring load sharing and cues for knee flexion initiation
- Materials Needed: Hip slides p.7-9; gait cycle video; anatomy atlas landmarks page
