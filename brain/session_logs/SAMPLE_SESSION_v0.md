- Time: 14:00
- Duration: 45 minutes
- Study Mode: Core

## Topic Coverage
- Main Topic: Hip extensors synergy and gait cycle integration
- Subtopics: Gluteus maximus firing sequence, hamstring co-activation, stance-phase stability cues

## Execution Details
- Frameworks Used: H1,M2
- SOP Modules Used: M0,M1,M2,M3,M6
- Engines Used: Anatomy Engine
- Core Learning Modules Used: PERRO, KWIK
- Gated Platter Triggered: No
- WRAP Phase Reached: Yes
- Anki Cards Created: 4
- Off-source drift? (Y/N): N
- Source snippets used? (Y/N): Y
- Prompt Drift? (Y/N): Y
- Prompt Drift Notes: model started lecturing before planning confirmation

## Reflection

### What Worked
- Using PERRO to restate the stance-phase checklist anchored the muscle timing sequence.
- Anatomy Engine prompts surfaced specific palpation cues that clarified gluteus maximus vs hamstring contributions.

### What Needs Fixing
- Need tighter guardrails before teaching mode to prevent drift into mini-lectures.
- Add explicit pause for plan confirmation after the WRAP checklist to avoid rework.

### Notes/Insights
- M6 rollback prompt was unnecessary today but keeping it ready reduced anxiety.

## Next Session Priority
- Topic: Posterior thigh innervation map
- Focus: Differentiate tibial vs common fibular divisions in clinical scenarios
- Materials Needed: Lab dissection photos, nerve lesion case vignettes
