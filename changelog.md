## Version 7.2 (Previous)

**Release Date:** November 24, 2025

### Major Additions

#### 1. NMMF Framework (Section 2.5)

**Name → Meaning → Memory Hook → Function**

A systematic approach to learning and remembering complex terminology.

**Components:**

- **Name:** State term exactly as in source material
- **Meaning:** Etymology or "sounds like" explanation to reduce cognitive load
- **Memory Hook:** Simple image/metaphor tied directly to mechanism
- **Function:** One-sentence description connected to the hook

**Purpose:**

- Binds terminology → mechanism → hook in one small chunk
- Reduces cognitive load on complex terms
- Creates strong, mechanism-linked retrieval cues

**Example:**

```
Name: Astrocyte
Meaning: Astro- = star (star-shaped cells)
Memory Hook: "Mom cells" – feed, protect, clean
Function: Astrocytes are 'mom cells' that feed and protect neurons 
while cleaning up the neuronal environment
```

**Impact:**

- Standardizes approach to terminology across all topics
- Makes hook creation systematic, not random
- Ensures every key anchor has a memorable retrieval cue

---

#### 2. Hook Integration Rule (HIR) (Section 2.6)

**Mandatory reuse of memory hooks across all learning phases**

**Five Integration Points:**

1. **Initial Teaching** – Use hook when first explaining concept
2. **Recall Prompts** – Cue with hook during Brain Dump/Teach-Back
3. **Anki Cards** – Include hook on back of flashcard
4. **Recap Sheet** – List under "Memory Devices & Hooks" section
5. **Consistency** – Use same hook throughout session; update everywhere if changed

**Purpose:**

- Prevents "hook drift" (changing hooks mid-session)
- Strengthens retrieval cues through repetition
- Makes hooks permanent memory aids, not one-off jokes

**Rule:**

If an anchor has a hook, it must appear in:  
**Teaching → Recall → Cards → Recap**

**Impact:**

- Dramatically improves hook effectiveness
- Creates consistent retrieval cues across all study materials
- Ensures hooks are reinforced, not forgotten

---

#### 3. Personal Encoding Step (PES) (Section 2.7)

**User-generated or user-modified hooks for active encoding**

**Process:**

1. AI presents NMMF with default hook
2. AI prompts user: "What does this remind *you* of?"
3. User adopts, tweaks, or creates entirely new hook
4. AI locks in user's version and uses it everywhere
5. If user is blank, AI offers 1–2 candidates for user to choose/modify

**Purpose:**

- Forces **active encoding** (not passive acceptance)
- Creates personally meaningful associations
- Dramatically increases retention
- Makes learning feel natural and memorable

**Example:**

```
AI: "I'm calling astrocytes 'mom cells.' Does that work for you?"

User: "I like 'support staff' better – like the crew that keeps a 
theater running."

AI: "Perfect! We'll use 'support staff' as your hook."
```

**Impact:**

- Transforms hooks from AI-imposed to user-owned
- Leverages personal experience and associations
- Increases engagement and ownership of learning

---

### Minor Improvements

- **Enhanced hook quality criteria** throughout documentation
- **Clearer integration** of hooks into all phases (MAP, LOOP, WRAP)
- **Explicit hook reuse** in recall prompts and corrections
- **Standardized hook placement** in Anki cards and recap sheets
- **Emphasis on mechanism-linked hooks** (not random associations)

---

### Documentation Updates

- Added detailed NMMF, HIR, and PES sections to Core SOP
- Updated Methods Index with new protocols
- Enhanced examples throughout to show hook integration
- Clarified hook quality criteria and best practices
- Added troubleshooting guidance for hook creation

---

## Version 7.1 (Previous)

**Release Date:** Prior to November 2025

### Features

- **MAP → LOOP → WRAP framework** established
- **Smart Prime** with anchor building
- **Active recall protocols** (Brain Dump, Teach-Back)
- **Strength labeling system** (Strong/Moderate/Weak)
- **Framework selection** (Structure → Function, Mechanism → Outcome, etc.)
- **Level of Understanding (LoU)** assessment
- **Anki card generation** for weak points
- **One-page recap sheets**
- **Fast/Exam Crunch Mode** for time-constrained sessions
- **Source-Lock protocol**
- **Always-on rules** (Active Recall Gate, One-Small-Step, Summary & Save)

### Limitations Addressed in v7.2

- **Hooks were optional** – No systematic approach to creating them
- **Hooks were inconsistent** – Could change or be forgotten mid-session
- **Hooks were AI-imposed** – No user personalization or active encoding
- **No integration rule** – Hooks might appear once and never again
- **No terminology framework** – Complex terms handled ad-hoc

## Version History Summary

| Version | Release Date | Key Features | Major Changes |
|---------|--------------|--------------|---------------|
| **7.2** | Nov 24, 2025 | NMMF, HIR, PES | Systematic hook creation, mandatory reuse, user personalization |
| **7.1** | Prior to Nov 2025 | MAP → LOOP → WRAP, active recall, frameworks | Established core SOP structure |
| **7.0 and earlier** | Historical | Various iterations | Foundation development |

---

## Migration Guide: v7.1 → v7.2

### For Students

**What's New:**

1. **You'll be prompted to create/modify hooks** for key concepts (PES)
2. **Hooks will be reused consistently** throughout your session (HIR)
3. **Every key term gets NMMF treatment** (Name → Meaning → Hook → Function)

**What Stays the Same:**

- MAP → LOOP → WRAP structure
- Brain Dump and Teach-Back protocols
- Anki card and recap generation
- All always-on rules

**Action Items:**

- None – v7.2 is backward compatible
- Simply engage with PES prompts when offered
- Your personalized hooks will make learning more effective

---

### For AI Study Coaches

**Implementation Changes:**

1. **Add NMMF block** for every anchor with a key term
   - Name, Meaning, Memory Hook, Function

2. **Run PES after NMMF**
   - Prompt user for personal hook
   - Lock in user's version
   - Use it everywhere

3. **Apply HIR consistently**
   - Reuse hooks in teaching
   - Cue with hooks in recall
   - Include hooks on cards
   - List hooks in recap

4. **Update card and recap templates**
   - Add hook reminder to card backs
   - Add "Memory Devices & Hooks" section to recaps

**Backward Compatibility:**

- All v7.1 protocols still apply
- NMMF/HIR/PES are additions, not replacements
- Can run v7.1-style sessions if needed (though v7.2 is preferred)

---

## Planned Future Enhancements

### Under Consideration for v7.3+

- **Spaced repetition scheduling** integrated into SOP
- **Multi-session topic tracking** (beyond single-session scope)
- **Visual map generation** (automated flowcharts/diagrams)
- **Case-based learning protocols** (extended clinical scenarios)
- **Peer teaching mode** (structured study group facilitation)
- **Exam simulation mode** (timed, mixed-topic quizzes)
- **Progress analytics** (strength trends over time)

### Community Feedback Welcome

If you have suggestions for future versions:

1. Test them in real study sessions
2. Document what worked and what didn't
3. Share your findings

The goal is continuous refinement based on real-world use.
