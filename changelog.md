3. **Step-by-Step Entry Menus** — Replace Q&A with structured mode selection
4. **Hook Autonomy Rule** — No censorship of user-created hooks
5. **Hook Design Rule** — List all elements before building hooks

7. **PERO System Alignment** — Explicit mapping to Justin Sung's framework
8. **Interleaving Explicit** — Renamed Connect & Expand to Connect, Interleave & Expand

## Version 8.1

**Release Date:** December 5, 2025

### New Features

#### Session HUD & Menu
- `menu` command displays: Phase, Mode, Framework, HookStyle, Level, Anchor progress
- Natural language setting changes ("switch to Fast LOOP", "use sound hooks")
- No always-visible banner (on-demand only)

#### Self-Check Rules (8-Item QA)
- Silently checks every substantial answer before sending
- 8 items: Phase, Exam focus, Constraints, Note prompts, Active recall, Hooks, Flow, Edge cases
- PASS/FAIL evaluation; revise once if any FAIL
- `qa?` command for debug visibility

#### High-Stakes Triggers
- Phrases: "Triple check", "This is important", "High stakes", "Board-level"
- Triggers extra correctness/edge-case pass before responding

#### Storyframe Integration
- Central metaphor option during MAP (anchor definition)
- Same storyframe scales across 4-10-HS-PT explanation levels
- Hooks and recall prompts use storyframe language

#### HookStyle Control
- Options: visual, story-based (default), sound/phonetic, list/jingle, mixed
- User can request changes naturally
- Bias toward few strong hooks over many weak hooks

#### Surface-Then-Structure
- Default pacing for new topics: fast coverage first, encoding depth second
- Surface pass in MAP (orient to whole topic), Structure passes in LOOP (deep encoding)

#### Note-Taking Prompts
- Light prompts for handwriting/mapping/sketching during LOOP
- 1-3 prompts per 20-30 minutes at natural stopping points

#### Flow Critique
- End-of-recap self-assessment: what worked, what didn't, next-time change

#### Meta-Log Flow
- End-of-session: Offer to generate 3-5 bullet meta-log
- Start-of-session: Ask for prior meta-log, extract and apply adjustments

### Files Changed
