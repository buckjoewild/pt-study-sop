1. Typography & Readability (The High-Impact Fix)
The biggest issue currently is the pixelated font used for everything. While it looks cool in headers, it is difficult to read when small, causing eye strain.

Font Pairing: Keep the pixel font (like "Press Start 2P") for the Headers (e.g., "JANUARY 2026", "TREY'S STUDY SYSTEM") and the Day Names (SUN, MON).

Body Text Switch: Switch to a Monospace font (like JetBrains Mono, Roboto Mono, or Fira Code) for the actual calendar events and lists.

Why? Monospace fonts preserve the "hacker/terminal" vibe but are designed for legibility at small sizes.

Line Height: Increase the line height (vertical spacing) slightly on the event items to stop them from looking crushed together.

2. Color & Contrast Management
The stark Red (#FF0000) on Black (#000000) is classic, but it causes "chromatic aberration" (a vibrating effect) on modern screens, making it tiring to look at for long periods.

Soften the Red: Shift the red slightly towards a Tomato or Crimson color (e.g., #FF4444 or #D32F2F) for text. It will still look red but will be easier on the eyes.

Background Depth: Instead of pure black (#000000), try a very dark grey (#121212) for the calendar cell backgrounds. This reduces the harsh contrast.

Categorical Color Coding: Currently, all events are white text.

Suggestion: Use the left border of the event text or a small dot to indicate the category (e.g., Green for "New Job," Blue for "PHYT" classes, Yellow for "Personal").

Keep the colors desaturated so they don't clash with the red theme.

3. Visual Hierarchy & Spacing
The calendar grid feels very "tight," and the borders are quite thick.

Thinner Grid Lines: Reduce the thickness of the calendar grid borders to 1px and make them a dark grey (e.g., #333333) rather than red or white. This lets the content define the grid rather than the lines.

Active State: The "Today" highlight (currently a red box) is good, but consider using a hollow red glow (box-shadow) or just highlighting the date number, rather than filling the whole header.

Padding: Add 4px or 8px of padding inside the calendar cells so the text doesn't touch the borders.

4. UI Polish & "The Vibe"
Scrollbars: The standard white browser scrollbar on the right (and inside the sidebar) breaks the immersion.

Fix: Use CSS to style the scrollbar. Make the track dark grey and the "thumb" (the moving part) red to match the UI.

Event Overflow: Looking at the 4th, 5th, and 6th, you have +4, +12, +10. This suggests information overload.

Fix: Instead of just a number, consider a hover effect or a "Day View" modal that pops up when you click a busy day.

Button Consistency: The "CREATE EVENT" button is a solid red block. To make it pop more, give it a slight hover animation (e.g., pixel shift or color inversion) to make the UI feel "alive."

5. The Sidebar Layout
The right sidebar is a bit cluttered compared to the main calendar.

Mini Calendar: It looks great, but ensure the current day (17) is highlighted distinctly (perhaps a red circle or square).

Google Status: The "Google Connected / Disconnect" box takes up a lot of prime real estate. This could be moved to a settings menu or made into a much smaller status indicator (like a small green LED dot) to save space for Tasks or To-Dos.
