# Dashboard Surface Gap Plan (React vs Legacy)

## Summary
Compare the React dashboard rebuild to the legacy HTML/JS dashboard, identify missing or mismatched functionality across the full surface, and outline a phased roadmap to reach parity while keeping API wiring correct and documented.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Every dashboard surface is listed with purpose, UI status, and API dependencies.
- React-to-backend wiring is mapped with clear status (ok/partial/missing).
- Legacy-only features and data-shape mismatches are explicitly called out.
- A phased roadmap lists what to implement and why (parity + stability).
- Risks/unknowns are flagged with next verification steps.

## Scope
**In**
- Archived React UI under `archive/dashboards/brain_static_react/src/pages` and `archive/dashboards/brain_static_react/src/components/layout.tsx`.
- Legacy dashboard UI under `brain/templates/dashboard.html` and `brain/static/js/dashboard.js`.
- Backend API surface under `brain/dashboard/api_adapter.py` and `brain/dashboard/routes.py`.

**Out**
- Implementation changes or schema refactors.
- External service validation (Google, Anki, Blackboard) beyond wiring checks.

## Gap Analysis (Per Surface)
### Shell + Notes
- React uses DB-backed notes via `/api/notes`, legacy uses localStorage notes sidebar.
- React navigation does not include Sync Inbox route.

### Overview
- React has stats/trends/insights UI but uses placeholder streak/level logic.
- Legacy includes additional panels (alerts, detailed insights, upload log wiring).
- React upload card has no handler for `/api/upload`.

### Brain
- React missing fast-entry prompt ingestion, resume generation, session edit modal, upload flow, mastery/ingestion stats, and Anki drafts sync.
- React only supports minimal session create/delete without full v9.1 fields.

### Calendar
- React month/week/day/tasks views exist; legacy includes syllabus list view, import flows, course color manager, planned repetition creation.
- React calls `/api/events` create/update/delete, but backend only supports read/update/delete partially.
- Google Tasks: React uses a default list convenience endpoint that does not exist.

### Scholar
- React has UI for digest, Ralph, proposal sheet, coverage, questions; backend provides most `/api/scholar/*` endpoints.
- Safe-mode and multi-agent toggles are UI-only; no backing endpoint.
- Proposal CRUD is limited to status-only updates.

### Tutor
- React chat is mostly mocked and does not integrate RAG sources or file/URL ingestion from legacy.
- Adapter chat history returns `role`, but React expects `sender`.

### Sync Inbox
- React missing Sync Inbox tab entirely; legacy uses `/api/sync/*` and `/api/scraper/run`.

### Data Model Mismatch
- React uses shared schema (`archive/dashboards/brain_static_react/shared/schema.ts`) with `sessions.duration` string and `sessions.mode` text, while adapter returns `durationMinutes` and omits `mode`.

## Roadmap (Phased)
### Phase 0: Canonical UI + Wiring Baseline
- Canonical frontend is `brain/static/dist` (Flask serves dist first).
- Document React route map and add Sync Inbox route placeholder.

### Phase 1: Core Wiring Parity
- Align session payload shape (duration/mode fields).
- Add missing endpoints: `/api/events` POST, `/api/tasks` PATCH/DELETE.
- Add Google Tasks convenience routes or update React to use existing endpoints.

### Phase 2: Brain Parity
- Implement fast entry ingest, upload, resume generation, mastery stats, and Anki drafts sync.
- Add session edit modal and full v9.1 field mapping.

### Phase 3: Calendar + Syllabus Parity
- Add syllabus import flows, course color manager, list view, planned repetition UI.
- Confirm Google Calendar write permissions and surface errors in UI.

### Phase 4: Tutor Parity
- Replace mock responses with Tutor engine turn calls.
- Add RAG source management (folder sync, runtime catalog, URL ingestion).

### Phase 5: Scholar Enhancements
- Wire safe-mode/multi-agent toggles and question answering to backend.
- Ensure proposal approvals update `scholar/outputs` and DB consistently.

### Phase 6: Sync Inbox + QA
- Build Sync Inbox UI and wire `/api/sync/*` + `/api/scraper/run`.
- Run regression smoke checklist from `AGENTS.md` (pytest + release check + manual dashboard run).

## Risks / Unknowns
- External integrations (Google, Anki, Blackboard) need credentialed testing.
- Archived dashboards are stored under `archive/dashboards/` and can be restored if needed.
- Legacy-only modals may still be required for parity; inventory in `docs/dashboard_audit.md`.
