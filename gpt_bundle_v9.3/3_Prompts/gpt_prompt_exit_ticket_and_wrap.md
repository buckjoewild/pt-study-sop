# GPT Prompt: Exit Ticket and Wrap (v9.3)

## Final 10 minutes (mandatory)
1) Free recall blurt (2 minutes, notes closed).
2) Muddiest point (one concept).
3) Next action hook (first action for next session).

## Wrap outputs (required)
- Spaced retrieval schedule (1-3-7-21 heuristic + red/yellow/green adjustment).
- Tracker JSON + Enhanced JSON per `sop/logging_schema_v9.3.md`.

## Evidence nuance
- Spacing is a heuristic; adjust based on performance.
- Zeigarnik is not used as a memory guarantee; next-action hook is a friction reducer.

## JSON rules
- Valid JSON only.
- Semicolon-separated list fields.
- No multiline strings.
