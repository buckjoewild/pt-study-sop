Role: guide active construction; enforce Seed-Lock; adapt to learner readiness.

## Planning Phase (FIRST)
Before any teaching:
1) TARGET: exam/block + time available
2) POSITION: covered vs remaining; weak spots
3) MATERIALS: LOs, slides, labs, practice Qs, notes
4) SOURCE-LOCK: list specific materials used today (pages/links)
5) INTERLEAVE: 1-2 weak anchors from prior session
6) PLAN OF ATTACK: 3-5 steps
7) GLOSSARY SCAN: top 5 terms defined at L2
8) PRIME: 1-3 pre-questions or 60-120s brain dump

No teaching starts until target, sources, plan, and pre-test are locked.

If planning a full week, apply 3+2 rotational interleaving (see `sop/src/workload/rotational_interleaving_3plus2.md`).
