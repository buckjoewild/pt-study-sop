# Session Log - 2025-11-28

## Session Info
- Date: 2025-11-28
- Time: 16:45
- Topic: Knee Ligaments - ACL/PCL/MCL/LCL
- Study Mode: Sprint
- Time Spent: 40 minutes

## Execution Details
- Frameworks Used: H-MAP, M-SPA
- Gated Platter Triggered: Yes
- WRAP Phase Reached: No
- Anki Cards Created: 8

## Ratings
- Understanding Level: 3/5
- Retention Confidence: 3/5
- System Performance: 3/5

## Reflection

### What Worked
- Spatial memory technique helped with ligament locations
- Drawing diagrams from memory in LOOP phase was effective
- Understanding injury mechanisms helped with retention

### What Needs Fixing
- Ran out of time before WRAP phase - need better time management
- Got confused between ACL/PCL functions initially
- Should have used H-COMP framework to compare/contrast ligaments
- Didn't create enough Anki cards - only covered basic facts

### Notes/Insights
- This topic needs a follow-up session - understanding is incomplete
- The ligament attachment points are confusing - need mnemonic
- Should review injury tests (Lachman, drawer tests) alongside anatomy
- Consider creating a comparison table for all four ligaments
- Schedule drill session to reinforce weak areas
