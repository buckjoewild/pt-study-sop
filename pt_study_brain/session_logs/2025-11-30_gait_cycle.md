## Reflection

### What Worked
- H-SEQ framework perfect for temporal/sequential information
- Animated GIFs helped with visualizing movement phases
- Breaking down stance vs swing phase first, then subdividing
- Memory palace: visualized walking through my house for each phase

### What Needs Fixing
- Initial MAP phase took too long - need better pre-organization
- Some redundancy in Anki cards - could be more efficient

### Notes/Insights
- Gait cycle is 60% stance, 40% swing - this ratio helps anchor the phases
- Connecting each phase to common pathologies (e.g., foot drop in swing phase) makes it clinically relevant
- The muscle activation patterns make sense when understood biomechanically first
- This is a strong foundation topic - many other concepts will reference this
