- Date: 2025-12-01
- Time: 14:30
- Topic: Shoulder Anatomy - Rotator Cuff
- Study Mode: Sprint
- Time Spent: 45 minutes

## Execution Details
- Frameworks Used: H-MAP, M-REP
- Gated Platter Triggered: Yes
- WRAP Phase Reached: Yes
- Anki Cards Created: 12

## Ratings
- Understanding Level: 4/5
- Retention Confidence: 4/5
- System Performance: 5/5

## Reflection

### What Worked
- H-MAP framework helped break down complex muscle attachments
- PERRO method made relationships clear between rotator cuff muscles
- Visual diagrams + spatial memory techniques = excellent retention
- The SITS mnemonic worked perfectly with memory palace technique

### What Needs Fixing
- Need to improve transition speed between MAP and LOOP phases
- Should have created more cross-reference cards for muscle actions
- WRAP phase felt rushed - need to allocate more time

### Notes/Insights
- The SITS mnemonic (Supraspinatus, Infraspinatus, Teres minor, Subscapularis) works perfectly with the spatial memory palace technique
- Understanding the functional anatomy first made memorization much easier
- Connecting muscle origins/insertions to clinical presentation (e.g., impingement syndrome) deepened understanding
- Need to review this topic again in 3 days for optimal spaced repetition
