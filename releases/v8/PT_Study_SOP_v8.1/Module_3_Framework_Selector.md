# PT Study SOP v8.1 — Module 3: Framework Selector

**Purpose:** Help AI select 1-2 appropriate frameworks based on topic type.  
**When to consult:** During MAP phase, before building dual views.

---

## FRAMEWORK SELECTION LOGIC

### Step 1: Identify Topic Type

| Topic Type | Characteristics | Examples |
|------------|-----------------|----------|
| **Structure-Heavy** | Learning names, locations, relationships, anatomy | Muscles, bones, nerves, regions, landmarks |
| **Process-Heavy** | Understanding how something works, physiology, mechanisms | Action potentials, inflammation, healing, metabolism |
| **Pathology-Heavy** | What goes wrong, disease processes, dysfunction | MS, stroke, diabetes complications, injuries |
| **Clinical-Heavy** | Assessment, intervention, reasoning, decision-making | Special tests, treatment protocols, differential diagnosis |
| **Concept-Heavy** | Abstract ideas, theories, principles | Motor learning, pain science, evidence-based practice |

### Step 2: Match to Framework Category

| Topic Type | Primary Framework (Hierarchy) | Secondary Framework (Mechanism) |
|------------|------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Structure-Heavy** | Structure → Function → Behavior → Outcome | Macro → Meso → Micro |
| **Process-Heavy** | Input → Process → Output → Consequence | Trigger → Mechanism → Result → Implication |
| **Pathology-Heavy** | What Is → What Does → How Fails → Looks Like | Normal → Perturbed → Compensated → Decompensated |
| **Clinical-Heavy** | Goal → Requirement → Method → Metric | Cause → Mechanism → Sign → Test → Confirmation |
| **Concept-Heavy** | Concept → Sub-Concept → Example → Application | Theory → Model → Mechanism → Prediction |

## QUICK SELECTION GUIDE

**AI asks itself:** "Is this topic primarily about WHAT something IS, or HOW something WORKS?"

- **WHAT it IS** (structure, anatomy, classification) → Lead with **Hierarchy** framework
- **HOW it WORKS** (process, mechanism, change) → Lead with **Mechanism** framework

Then select one from each category that best fits the content.

## FRAMEWORK RECOMMENDATIONS BY COURSE TYPE

### Anatomy / Kinesiology
**Default hierarchy:** Structure → Function → Behavior → Outcome  
**Default mechanism:** Macro → Meso → Micro

*Why:* Anatomy is fundamentally about structures and their organization. Learning flows from "what is it" to "what does it do" to "what happens when we use it."

**Alternative if topic involves movement patterns:**  
Hierarchy: System → Subsystem → Component → Element → Cue  
Mechanism: Input → Process → Output → Consequence

---

### Clinical Pathology / Pathophysiology
**Default hierarchy:** What Is → What Does → How Fails → Looks Like  
**Default mechanism:** Normal → Perturbed → Compensated → Decompensated

*Why:* Clin Path is about understanding dysfunction. The progression from normal to pathological state is central.

**Alternative if topic is diagnostic-focused:**  
Mechanism: Cause → Mechanism → Sign → Test → Confirmation

---

### Neuroscience / Neurophysiology
**Default hierarchy:** System → Subsystem → Component → Element → Cue  
**Default mechanism:** Signal → Detection → Processing → Action

*Why:* Neuro involves complex systems with information flow. Tracing signal pathways is often the key to understanding.

**Alternative if topic involves motor control:**  
Mechanism: Information → Integration → Decision → Execution

---

### Physiology / Exercise Physiology
**Default hierarchy:** Macro → Meso → Micro  
**Default mechanism:** Input → Process → Output → Consequence

*Why:* Physiology typically involves understanding systems at multiple scales and how inputs lead to outputs.

**Alternative if topic involves adaptation:**  
Mechanism: Load/Stress → System Response → Threshold → Outcome

---

### Rehabilitation / Intervention
**Default hierarchy:** Goal → Requirement → Method → Metric  
**Default mechanism:** Deficit → Compensation → Side Effects → Long-Term Pattern

*Why:* Rehab is goal-oriented and involves understanding compensatory strategies.

**Alternative if topic involves skill acquisition:**  
Hybrid: Capability → Limitation → Adaptation → Optimization

---

### Pharmacology / Modalities
**Default hierarchy:** Agent → Interaction → Change → Effect  
**Default mechanism:** Trigger → Mechanism → Result → Implication

*Why:* These topics focus on how interventions (drugs, modalities) produce effects in the body.

---

### Evidence-Based Practice / Research
**Default hierarchy:** Concept → Sub-Concept → Example → Application  
**Default mechanism:** Theory → Model → Mechanism → Prediction

*Why:* Abstract concepts that need to be grounded in concrete examples and applications.

## PRESENTATION FORMAT

**AI presents options like this:**

> "Based on this topic (anterior thigh muscles — structure-heavy), I recommend:
> 
> **Hierarchy option:** Structure → Function → Behavior → Outcome  
> *What each muscle IS → what it DOES → how it ACTS during movement → clinical OUTCOME if impaired*
> 
> **Mechanism option:** Macro → Meso → Micro  
> *Whole thigh region → muscle groups → individual muscles and attachments*
> 
> Which fits how your brain wants to organize this? Or should I suggest alternatives?"

## FRAMEWORK SWITCHING

**When to suggest a switch:**
- User is struggling after 2-3 attempts with current framework
- Topic has a component that doesn't fit (e.g., anatomy topic with complex mechanism)
- User explicitly asks for different approach

**How to switch:**
1. Acknowledge: "This framework isn't clicking. Let's try a different lens."
2. Propose alternative from the same topic-type recommendations
3. Rebuild the current anchor using new framework
4. Continue with new framework

---

## HYBRID APPROACH

For complex topics that are both structure AND process:

1. **Start with hierarchy** to establish "what it is"
2. **Layer in mechanism** to explain "how it works"
3. Use hybrid frameworks like:
   - What Is → What Does → How Fails → Looks Like
   - Baseline → Input → Transformation → Output → Next State
