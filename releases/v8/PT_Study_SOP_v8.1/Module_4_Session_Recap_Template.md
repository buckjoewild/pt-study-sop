## SECTION-BY-SECTION GUIDANCE

### EXAM TRACKER
**Purpose:** Keep the big picture visible - where does this topic fit in exam prep?

**AI fills in:**
- Exam name and what modules it covers (user provides this info once)
- Updates completed/in-progress/remaining each session
- Carries forward from previous recap if resuming

**Example:**
```
Exam: Exam 3 - Modules 7, 8, 9
- Completed: Mod 7 (CNS overview), Mod 8 LO 1-3
- In Progress: Mod 8 LO 4 (Peripheral nerve injuries) - finished anchors, need recall
- Remaining: Mod 8 LO 5-7, Mod 9 (all)
```

---

### SUMMARY
**Purpose:** Quick orientation for future self - what was this about?

**Guidelines:**
- Write like you're explaining to yourself in 2 weeks
- Plain English, no jargon unless necessary
- Focus on the "so what" - why does this matter?
- 3-5 sentences max

**Example:**
```
This covered the muscles of the anterior thigh - the quadriceps group plus sartorius. The key insight is that all four quad muscles share a common insertion (tibial tuberosity via patellar tendon) but have different origins, which explains their slightly different actions. Sartorius is the oddball - it's the longest muscle in the body and does hip flexion + external rotation + knee flexion (think: crossing your legs). Clinically, quad weakness shows up as difficulty with stairs and transfers.
```

---

### MECHANISM MAPS
**Purpose:** Visual chains that can be quickly rescanned to rebuild mental model

**Guidelines:**
- Use arrows (->) to show flow/sequence
- One map per major system or process
- Keep each map to one line if possible
- Include start point and end point/outcome

**Examples:**
```
Map 1: Quad Function Chain
Hip flexion (RF only) -> Knee extension -> Patellar tendon -> Tibial tuberosity -> Standing/stairs/kicking

Map 2: Femoral Nerve Injury Pattern
Femoral n. damage -> Quad weakness -> Can't extend knee -> Difficulty stairs -> Compensate with hip hike
```

---

### ANCHORS + HOOKS
**Purpose:** List all anchors with their memory devices and current status

**Guidelines:**
- Number each anchor
- Include the exact hook phrase
- Mark current status: Strong / Moderate / Weak
- Be honest about status - this drives next session focus

**Example:**
```
1. Rectus Femoris - "The only quad that crosses both joints - the overachiever" - Strong
2. Vastus Group - "The three V's: Lateral, Medial, Intermedius = outside, inside, deep" - Moderate
3. Sartorius - "Tailor's muscle, sitting cross-legged" - Weak
4. Femoral Nerve - "L2-L4, runs with femoral artery under inguinal ligament" - Moderate
```

---

### FRAMEWORKS USED
**Purpose:** Record which organizational approach worked for this topic

**Guidelines:**
- Name the framework exactly
- Briefly note how it was applied
- Helps future sessions start with what worked

**Example:**
```
Primary: Structure + Function + Behavior + Outcome
- Used for: Each muscle's anatomy + action + movement contribution + clinical implication

Secondary: Macro + Meso + Micro
- Used for: Organizing thigh region + muscle groups + individual muscles
```

---

### MEMORY DEVICES
**Purpose:** Capture any mnemonics, stories, or personal connections beyond individual hooks

**Guidelines:**
- Include course-specific mnemonics
- Include personal connections that helped
- Note what each device helps remember

**Example:**
```
- "SITS" for rotator cuff - but we didn't cover that this session
- Personal: Sartorius = "Sitting at Rob's house" (my friend who always sits cross-legged)
- The quads are like a team of 4 workers all pulling on the same rope (patellar tendon)
```

---

### WEAK POINTS / NEXT TIME
**Purpose:** Specific gaps that need attention - drives next session focus

**Guidelines:**
- Be specific - not "quads" but "vastus intermedius origin"
- Note the type of weakness: recall? understanding? application?
- Include distinctions that were confusing
- Include question types that were hard

**Example:**
```
- Sartorius actions - kept forgetting it does external rotation at hip
- Difference between vastus lateralis and medialis fiber direction - why does it matter?
- Couldn't explain why RF is the only quad that can flex hip (crosses hip joint)
- Struggled with clinical scenario: "Patient can't straighten knee - which muscle/nerve?"
```

---

### NEXT SESSION PLAN
**Purpose:** Clear starting point for future session

**Guidelines:**
- Based on weak points, recommend specific focus
- Suggest appropriate triage mode
- Estimate time needed

**Example:**
```
Recommended focus: Sartorius actions + RF hip flexion mechanism + clinical reasoning for quad weakness
Suggested mode: Fast LOOP (you know the basics, need recall + application practice)
Time needed: ~30-45 min to solidify, or 15 min for quick recall drill
```

---

## MINI-RECAP (60-Second Version)
Use when full recap is not required.

**Template:**
Topic: [Course - Module - Topic]  
Date: [YYYY-MM-DD]  
Anchors Covered: [List]  
Strong / Moderate / Weak Summary  
Top 3 Hooks or Analogies  
Next Focus: [Next anchor or recall goal]  
Mode: [Recall Only / Fast LOOP / etc.]

**Purpose:** Keep daily continuity between sessions; ideal for multi-day topics.

---

## AI GENERATION INSTRUCTIONS

**At session end:**

1. Say: "Let me generate your recap."
2. Fill in all sections based on session content
3. Present complete recap in code block for easy copy
4. Remind: "Save this to NotebookLM/OneNote as: [Course - Module - Topic - YYYY-MM-DD]"
5. Remind: "Next session, say 'Resume [topic]' and paste this back"

**If session was interrupted/incomplete:**
- Still generate recap with whatever was covered
- Mark EXAM TRACKER as "In Progress" with specific stopping point
- WEAK POINTS should include "Did not complete: [remaining items]"

---

### Flow Critique (Session-Level)

At the end of the recap, add 2-4 bullets:

**Flow Notes:**
- **Mode/flow used:** [What actually happened - MAP -> LOOP -> WRAP, Compressed, etc.]
- **Worked well:** [Pacing, chunk size, hook styles, storyframe effectiveness]
- **Didn't work:** [Too deep too early, too many anchors, recall too sparse, etc.]
- **Next-time change:** [One concrete adjustment]

### Meta-Log Offer

After generating the recap, ask once:

> "Do you want a quick meta-log for how this session went?"

If yes, output:
```
[Meta-Log - Session Notes]
What worked well:
- [1-2 bullets]

What didn't work well:
- [1-2 bullets]

Changes for next time:
- [1-2 bullets]
```

Keep total to 3-5 bullets. Remind user they can paste this into notes and bring it back next session.
