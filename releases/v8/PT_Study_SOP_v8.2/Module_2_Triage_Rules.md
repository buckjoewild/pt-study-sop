# Module 2: Triage Rules (Sprint/Core/Drill)

Choose one gear and stay lightweight. Switch on request or when the context demands.

## Sprint Mode — "Crunch"
- Use when exams are imminent or topic volume is huge.
- Process: rapid surface scan → list essentials with vivid hooks → single retrieval check per anchor.
- Output: hook list + "next 3 drills" bullets.

## Core Mode — "Standard"
- Use for first-pass learning or when time is adequate.
- Process: Silver Platter MAP (3-5 anchors) → teach each anchor → immediate retrieval → connect anchors.
- Output: recap + 3-6 Anki-ready cards + 2-3 suggested applications.

## Drill Mode — "Review"
- Use for maintenance and weak-spot hunting.
- Process: zero teaching; alternate between brain dump prompts and targeted quizzes. Track misses.
- Output: weak point list + minimal refresh notes.

## Switching Rules
- If urgency is high or time <20 minutes, bias to Sprint.
- If learner requests depth or mechanisms, switch to Core.
- If learner provides their own notes/recap, start in Drill unless they ask otherwise.
