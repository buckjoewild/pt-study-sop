# Module 6: Framework Library (V8.2 Full Arsenal)

Use these codes to structure the "Silver Platter" MAP.
**Default Logic:** If unsure, use **Y1** (Structure) or **M2** (Mechanism).

## 1. The "Golden" Defaults
**Y1: The Generalist (Structure & Function)**
* What It Is → What It Does → How It Fails → What That Looks Like

**M2: The Mechanist (Process Chain)**
* Trigger → Mechanism → Result → Implication

---

## 2. Hierarchy Systems (H-Series) — *For Structure/Systems*
Use when defining *relationships* or *anatomy*.

* **H1 (The System):** System → Subsystem → Component → Element → Cue
* **H2 (The Standard):** Structure → Function → Behavior → Outcome
* **H3 (The Zoom):** Macro → Meso → Micro
* **H4 (The Concept):** Concept → Sub-Concept → Example → Application
* **H5 (The SOP):** Principle → Rule → Procedure → Action Step
* **H6 (The Science):** Theory → Model → Mechanism → Prediction
* **H7 (The Project):** Goal → Requirement → Method → Metric
* **H8 (The Interaction):** Agent → Interaction → Change → Effect

---

## 3. Mechanism Chains (M-Series) — *For Processes/Pathology*
Use when defining *flow*, *time*, or *cause-and-effect*.

* **M1 (The Factory):** Input → Process → Output → Consequence
* **M2 (The Trigger):** Trigger → Mechanism → Result → Implication
* **M3 (The Load):** Load/Stress → Response → Threshold → Outcome
* **M4 (The Compensation):** Deficit → Compensation → Side Effects → Pattern
* **M5 (The Signal):** Signal → Detection → Processing → Action
* **M6 (The Homeostasis):** Perturbation → Stability → Correction → Baseline
* **M7 (The Bottleneck):** Resource → Utilization → Limiter → Efficiency
* **M8 (The Diagnosis):** Cause → Mechanism → Sign → Test → Confirmation

---

## 4. Hybrid & Clinical (Y-Series) — *For Mixed Models*
Use for complex clinical pictures.

* **Y1 (The Anchor):** What It Is → What It Does → How It Fails → Looks Like
* **Y2 (The Pathology):** Normal → Perturbed → Compensated → Decompensated
* **Y3 (The State Machine):** Baseline → Input → Transform → Output → Next State
* **Y4 (The Adapter):** Capability → Limitation → Adaptation → Optimization
* **Y5 (The Brain):** Information → Integration → Decision → Execution

---

## 5. Pedagogical Tools (The Teachers)
* **Explanation Levels (4-10-HS-PT):** Scale depth from Level 1 (4yo Story) to Level 4 (Clinical).
* **Storyframe Strategy:** User & AI co-create a metaphor (e.g., "The Guarded Boat") to house the concepts.
