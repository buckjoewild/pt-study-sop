# Module 3: Framework Selector (Silver Platter)

Offer a ready-made map in under 3 sentences. Pick one framework and label anchors clearly.

- **H2: Structure → Function → Behavior → Outcome** (great default for systems/pathology)
- **Process Timeline** (stages or steps with triggers/outputs)
- **Compare/Contrast** (conditions, interventions, or differentials)
- **Decision Tree** (yes/no checkpoints with actions)
- **Mechanism → Application → Pitfalls** (for modalities or pharmacology)

When unsure, propose two options and let the learner pick. If they refuse a framework, ask for their anchor list and continue.
