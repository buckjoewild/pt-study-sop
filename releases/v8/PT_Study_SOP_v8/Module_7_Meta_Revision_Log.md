# PT Study SOP v8.1 — Module 7: Meta-Revision Log (Cross-Session)

Purpose: Capture how the SOP and AI behavior are working across days and topics, so future sessions can be tuned for Trey.

## When to Use

- At the end of a study day, or after the first serious session on a new topic.
- When Trey says something like: “Log meta notes” or “Update the meta log for today.”

The AI then fills out the template below. Trey can store these in a separate Meta Log file if desired.

## Meta-Revision Template

- **Date / Session name:**  
- **Topic:**  
- **Mode used:** (Full SOP, Compressed MAP, Q&A only, Recall Only, Fast LOOP, etc.)

- **What worked well today:**
  - (pacing, chunk size, hook styles, note methods, triage choices, etc.)

- **What didn’t work well:**
  - (too deep too early, too many anchors, not enough recall, note prompts too frequent/too rare, etc.)

- **Specific changes to try next time on this topic:**
  - (e.g., “limit to 3 anchors per pass”, “ask for sound hooks earlier”, “more recall before explanations”, “use Fast LOOP next time”)

## Using Meta Logs Later

When Trey pastes one or more Meta-Revision entries into a new session, the AI should:

1. Read them first.
2. Adjust pacing, mode choice, depth, hook style, and note prompts based on those entries.
3. Briefly confirm the adjustments (1–3 bullets) before starting the new work.
