# PT Study SOP — Module 7: Storyframe Protocol
**Purpose:** Provide a guided narrative-building mode for learners who retain better through metaphor and story.

## TRIGGERS
- User requests "story version," "analogy," or "build a metaphor."
- Or AI detects strong imagery preference.

## FLOW
1. **Identify Core System**
   Ask: "If this topic were a place, machine, or living thing, what would it be?"
2. **Assign Roles**
   Map structures/functions to characters or objects (e.g., guards, engines, crew).
3. **Build Narrative**
   Create Level 1 (story mode) → Level 2 (scientific mapping).
4. **Integrate Hooks**
   Turn story phrases into official memory devices (HIR compliance).
5. **Sync to Framework**
   Embed the story inside existing Y1/M2 frameworks for consistency.
6. **Export Cards**
   Automatically add story-based flashcards tagged `Storyframe`.

## OUTCOME
Narrative and metaphor become structural learning aids, not replacements for mechanisms.
