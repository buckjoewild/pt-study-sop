# PT Study SOP v9.1 Release Package

Everything you need to set up and run the PT Study Tutor system (general-first; anatomy engine optional).

---

## Quick Setup

### 1. Create CustomGPT
**Instructions field:** Copy contents of `GPT-INSTRUCTIONS.md` (paste as text, don't upload).
**Knowledge files:** Upload ALL 14 files from the `gpt-knowledge/` folder.

### 2. Set Up Brain (Session Tracking)
Use the root-level `brain/` (authoritative copy) for ingesting session logs and running the dashboard (the dashboard lives there; the release package does not include its own copy).

```powershell
cd brain
python db_setup.py
```

### 3. Start Studying
Open your CustomGPT and say: "Let's study."

## Usage Workflow
### Before Session
```powershell
cd brain
python generate_resume.py    # Optional: get context from past sessions
```

### During Session
1. Open CustomGPT.
2. Say "Let's study" or paste topic.
3. Complete Planning Phase (target, sources, plan).
4. Study with Seed-Lock and source-lock (mark unverified if no snippet).
5. Say "wrap" when done (WRAP drafts Anki-ready cards for weak anchors by default).
6. Copy the session summary.

### After Session
1. Create log file: `brain/session_logs/YYYY-MM-DD_topic.md`
2. Fill in from TEMPLATE.md using GPT's summary
3. Ingest to database:
```powershell
cd brain
python ingest_session.py session_logs/YYYY-MM-DD_topic.md
```

## Core Rules
1. **Seed-Lock (overrideable with warning)** — You must provide your own hook/metaphor before moving on.
2. **Function Before Structure** — Learn what it DOES before where it IS.
3. **Level Gating** — Prove L2 (teach-back) before advancing.
4. **Planning First** — No teaching until target + sources + plan established.
5. **Source-Lock / RAG-first** — Use declared sources; if none provided, outputs are marked **unverified**.
6. **Anatomy Order (when applicable)** — Bones + Landmarks + Attachments + OIAN + Clinical.
