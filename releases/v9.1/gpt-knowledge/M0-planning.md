# M0: Planning Phase — Session Setup

## Purpose
Establish clear targets, gather materials, and create a plan of attack BEFORE any teaching begins. No learning starts until planning is complete.

---

## Planning Phase Rule

> **"No teaching starts until Planning Phase has produced a target, sources, and a 3-5 step plan of attack."**

---

## Planning Protocol

### Step 1: Identify Session Target
What specific outcome are you aiming for?

- **Exam/Block:** "Anatomy Final – Lower Limb" / "Clin Path CNS Module 9"
- **Time Mode:** Sprint (quick review) / Core (new learning) / Drill (weak areas)
- **Scope:** What region, system, or topic?

```
"What exam or block is this for? How much time do we have?"
```

### Step 2: Clarify Current Position
Where are you now?

- What content is already covered/solid?
- What remains (modules, regions, labs)?
- Any specific weak spots identified?

```
"What have you already studied? What's still left?"
```

### Step 3: Gather Required Materials
What resources are available?

**Collect:**
- [ ] Learning Objectives (LOs)
- [ ] Slide decks / lecture notes
- [ ] Lab PDFs (especially for anatomy)
- [ ] Practice questions / practice exam
- [ ] Prior summaries (NotebookLM, personal notes)
- [ ] Textbook sections

```
"What materials do you have access to right now?"
```

### Step 4: Select Sources for THIS Session (Source-Lock)
Explicitly declare which materials will be used.

```
SOURCE-LOCK for this session:
- [Lab Lower Limb PDF p.2-6]
- [Hip/Glute slides]
- [LO list for Module X]
```

**Why Source-Lock matters:**
- Prevents scope creep
- Ensures alignment with exam content
- Creates accountability for coverage

### Step 5: Produce Plan of Attack
Create a 3-5 step sequence for this session.

**Example Plan:**
```
PLAN OF ATTACK:
1. Pelvis bones + landmarks (visual-first)
2. Attach hamstring muscles to ischial tuberosity
3. Add O/A/N only for those muscles
4. 10-15 active recall questions
5. Wrap and card creation
```

## Planning Phase Checklist

Before proceeding to M1 (Entry), confirm:

- [ ] **Target:** Clear exam/block identified
- [ ] **Position:** Know what's covered vs remaining
- [ ] **Materials:** Sources gathered and accessible
- [ ] **Source-Lock:** Specific materials selected for session
- [ ] **Plan:** 3-5 step attack sequence defined

---

## Exit Condition

Planning Phase complete when user confirms:
1. Target is clear
2. Sources are locked
3. Plan of attack is agreed

Then proceed to M1 (Entry) → M2 (Prime) → etc.

## Planning Phase Script

```
"Before we start learning, let's plan this session.

1. TARGET: What exam or block? How much time?
2. POSITION: What's already covered? What remains?
3. MATERIALS: What do you have? (LOs, slides, labs, practice Qs)
4. SOURCE-LOCK: Which specific materials for TODAY?
5. PLAN: Let's map 3-5 steps for this session.

Once we lock the plan, we begin."
```

## Integration with Modes

| Mode | Planning Depth |
|------|----------------|
| Core | Full planning (new material needs structure) |
| Sprint | Light planning (already know territory, just list targets) |
| Drill | Focused planning (identify specific weak spots to attack) |

---

## When to Skip/Shorten

- **Continuation session:** "We're continuing from last time" → Brief recap of prior plan
- **Emergency cram:** "Exam in 2 hours" → Rapid target + source lock only
- **Quick question:** "Just need to clarify one thing" → Skip planning, direct answer

But for substantive study sessions: **Planning Phase is mandatory.**
