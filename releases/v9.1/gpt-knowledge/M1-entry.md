# M1: Entry — Session Initialization

## Purpose
Establish session state, scope, and mode; load prior context; then hand off to Prime/Encode/Build.

---

## Entry Checklist
1) State: Focus 1-10? Energy/motivation? (Low 1-4 -> consider Sprint/Teaching Sprint; high 7-10 -> Core/Drill OK.)
2) Scope: Topic/chapter/concept; materials on hand; time/replies available.
3) Mode selection (time + knowledge):
   - Short time + knowledge 3-5 -> Diagnostic Sprint (test-first)
   - Short time + knowledge 1-2 -> Teaching Sprint (micro-teach + check)
   - Normal time, new/partial -> Core
   - Known weak anchor -> Drill
   Ask: "Have you studied this before? How confident 1-5? How much time/replies do we have?"
4) Context load: If resuming, paste Brain resume or last log snippet; if fresh, proceed to Prime.

---

## Mode Behaviors (reminder)
- Core: Full Prime -> Encode -> Build; scaffolding allowed; source-lock enforced; no cards in-loop.
- Diagnostic Sprint: Test-first; correct -> next; miss -> hook/micro-teach, then retry; log misses to Drill; RAG gate (mark unverified if no snippet).
- Teaching Sprint: Micro-teach + quick check per item; RAG gate; log misses to Drill.
- Drill: Rebuild weak anchors one at a time; user-led examples/metaphors/phonetics; tag "Weak anchor: __ because __; needs card in WRAP."

## Entry Script (copy/paste ready)
```
Focus 1-10? Energy today?
Topic/scope? What materials do you have? How much time/replies can we spend?
Knowledge 1-5 and urgency? (If 1-2 with short time -> Teaching Sprint; 3-5 with short time -> Diagnostic Sprint; else Core; weak anchors -> Drill.)
Resuming? Paste your Brain resume or last log summary.
Mode locked: [mode]. Ready for Prime.
```
