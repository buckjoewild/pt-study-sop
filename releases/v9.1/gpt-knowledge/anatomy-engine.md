# Anatomy Learning Engine

## Purpose
Specialized protocol for regional anatomy learning. Enforces order: Bones -> Landmarks -> Attachments -> OIAN -> Clinical. Prevents premature muscle-list memorization before spatial understanding is solid.

## Primary Goal
Build a clean mental atlas of every exam-relevant bone landmark: where it sits, what attaches there—before OIAN. OIAN should feel like a read-off from the atlas, not brute force.

## Mandatory Sequence
1) Bones
2) Landmarks
3) Attachments (O/I)
4) Actions (A)
5) Innervation (N)
6) Clinical

Constraints
- Not allowed: jumping to OIAN before bone + landmark mapping is solid.
- Not allowed: clinical patterns before OIAN is stable.
- Not allowed: muscle-first/OIAN-first approaches unless explicitly requested for quick review.

Why this order
Bones (scaffold) -> Landmarks (attachment points) -> Attachments (map) -> Actions (logic) -> Innervation (wiring) -> Clinical (application).

## Bone-First Attachment Loop
1) Select region (e.g., Pelvis & Hip, Anterior Thigh, Posterior Leg, Rotator Cuff).
2) List exam-required bones + landmarks (pull from lab PDFs/LOs).
3) Landmark Pass (visual-first) for each landmark:
   - Visual: shape/size/texture; how to spot in lab
   - Spatial: superior/inferior; anterior/posterior; medial/lateral; relations
   - Attachments: what originates/inserts here (names only at this stage)
4) Attach muscles (names only) per landmark; build attachment map table.
5) Layer OIAN only after map is solid (per muscle: O = landmark you know; I; A; N).
6) Add clinical patterns last.

## Visual-First Landmark Protocol
For each landmark:
- Visual recognition cues
- Spatial orientation
- Attachment importance (origins/insertions) — no full OIAN yet
Metaphors may support but cannot replace the actual visual. Visual-first is mandatory.

Rollback Rule
If struggling with OIAN: 1) review landmark visuals; 2) rebuild attachment map; 3) re-layer O/A/N. Never push OIAN on a shaky landmark base.

## Anatomy Session Flow
M0 (Planning) -> region + landmarks list
M2 (Prime) -> bones + landmarks map
M3 (Encode) -> Landmark Pass (visual, spatial, attachments)
M4 (Build) -> OIAN per muscle; clinical last
M6 (Wrap) -> review landmarks; draft cards for weak anchors

## Drawing Integration (when requested)
1) Draw bone outline (scaffold)
2) Mark landmarks (attachment points)
3) Add muscle lines origin -> insertion
4) Label O/I points
5) Annotate actions (arrows)

## Quick Reference
| Step | Focus | Question |
|------|-------|----------|
| 1 | Bones | What bones are in this region? |
| 2 | Landmarks | Where are the attachment points? |
| 3 | Attachments | What muscles connect here? |
| 4 | Actions | What do those attachments do? |
| 5 | Nerves | What controls those muscles? |
| 6 | Clinical | What happens when they fail? |

Violation check: If memorizing OIAN without landmarks, roll back.
