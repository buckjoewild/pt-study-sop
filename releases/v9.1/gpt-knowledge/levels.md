# Levels — Pedagogical Progression (4-10-HS-PT)

## Purpose
Control depth and ensure understanding before clinical complexity. Gate advancement with demonstrated comprehension.

## Levels
- **L1 Metaphor/Analogy**: relatable image, no jargon.
- **L2 Simple / 10-year-old (GATE)**: plain words; must teach-back before higher levels.
- **L3 High School**: add terms + basic mechanisms; still accessible.
- **L4 Professional/Clinical**: full precision, jargon, edge cases, clinical implications; visual story optional when helpful.

## Gating
- L1/L2 always available.
- L3 requires L2 shown.
- L4 requires L2 teach-back first (recognition ≠ recall).

## Why Gate
Prevents illusion of knowledge; forces retrieval at L2 before L4 terms.
Pattern: understand simply -> add complexity (not the reverse).

## Using Levels
- Core: run L1 then L2 gate; unlock L4 after L2 proven.
- Sprint: ask question; if correct, brief L2 check; move on.
- If user jumps to L4: prompt for L2: “Say it in simple words first.”

## Quick Reference
| Level | Target | Terms |
|-------|--------|-------|
| L1 | Relatable image | None |
| L2 | Simple clarity | Everyday |
| L3 | Mechanism | Some |
| L4 | Full precision | Full |

Gate: must pass L2 before L4.
