## WHAT EACH FILE COVERS

### 01 - MASTER OVERVIEW
- PEIRRO learning cycle (Prepare→Encode→Interrogate→Retrieve→Refine→Overlearn)
- KWIK encoding flow (Sound→Function→Image→Resonance→Lock)
- Level gating (L1-L4)
- H/M/Y frameworks
- Anatomy Engine (OIANA+)
- Concept Engine
- 5 Modes (Core/Sprint/Drill/Light/Quick Sprint)
- Workload management (3+2 rotation)
- Spaced retrieval (1-3-7-21)
- Metrics & logging
- Commands reference

### 02 - MODULES M0-M6
- M0: Planning (8-step protocol)
- M1: Entry (state check, mode selection)
- M2: Prime (H1 scan, bucketing)
- M3: Encode (KWIK flow, toolkit)
- M4: Build (practice ladder, fading)
- M5: Modes (behaviors, switching)
- M6: Wrap (exit ticket, metrics, JSON)

### 03 - SUPPLEMENTAL
- Templates (weekly plan, intake, metrics)
- Dialogue examples (Gated Platter, Sprint)
- Troubleshooting guide (stuck detection, fixes)
- Research notes by module (with citations)
- Learning science methods (retrieval, desirable difficulties, etc.)
- Legacy concepts (NMMF, HookStyles, governance rules)

### 04 - CONCEPTS LIBRARY ✅ NEW
Learning principles organized so you can study, research, and expand them:
- **Part 1: Encoding Strategies** — Dual coding, elaborative interrogation, generation effect, KWIK, NMMF
- **Part 2: Retrieval Strategies** — Testing effect, spaced retrieval, successive relearning, free vs cued recall
- **Part 3: Organization Strategies** — Chunking, hierarchical frameworks, mechanism frameworks, interleaving
- **Part 4: Metacognition** — Calibration, cognitive load, stuck detection, desirable difficulties
- **Part 5: Memory Techniques** — Phonetic hooks, visual-spatial, contrastive hooks, hook quality
- **Part 6: Session Design** — Planning, fading, wrap/consolidation, mode selection
- **Part 7: Evidence Summary** — What's well-cited vs heuristic

### 05 - MATERIAL INGESTION
- How to go from raw content to ready-to-study material
- What to extract from LOs, slides, videos, textbook
- NotebookLM workflow
- Time limits

### 06 - SESSION START
- Dead simple checklist when you sit down lost
- Find where you left off
- Pick target
- Go

### 07 - PROGRESS TRACKING
- Track modules/LOs/status
- Never lose your place
