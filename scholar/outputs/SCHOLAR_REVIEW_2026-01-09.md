# Scholar System Review — 2026-01-09

## Executive Summary

The Scholar meta-system is **well-structured and operational**. It has been successfully running and producing high-quality artifacts. The system demonstrates good architectural separation between research, proposals, and production code, with clear guardrails preventing accidental modifications.

## System Health ✅

### Working Components

1. **Orchestration**: Automated orchestrator loop with unattended runs working correctly
2. **Coverage Tracking**: Coverage checklist system tracking 22 items (10 complete, 2 in progress, 10 not started)
3. **Artifact Production**: 
   - 11 module dossiers completed
   - 6 research notebook entries
   - 6 promotion queue proposals
   - 4 audit reports
   - 7 system map documents
4. **Status Dashboard**: STATUS.md automatically updates via PowerShell script
5. **Git Integration**: Branch `scholar-orchestrator-loop` exists and is being used

### Recent Activity

- **Latest Run**: 2026-01-08 09:57:05 (unattended_final_2026-01-08_095705.md)
- **Last Artifact**: Anatomy Engine dossier (2026-01-08)
- **Current Status**: Safe mode = False (documentation/research only, no new proposals)

## Architecture Assessment

### Strengths

1. **Clear Separation of Concerns**
   - READ-ONLY access to production (`sop/`, `brain/`, `dist/`)
   - Separate output lanes (Research Notebook, Promotion Queue, Reports)
   - Explicit guardrails in CHARTER.md

2. **Well-Defined Workflows**
   - Unattended orchestrator loop with auto-advance
   - Coverage checklist drives prioritization
   - Templates provide consistency (module_dossier, change_proposal, etc.)

3. **Evidence-Based Process**
   - Pedagogy audit rubric (10 categories)
   - Research-backed proposals with citations
   - Telemetry analysis from session logs

4. **Quality Controls**
   - ONE-change-only rule for proposals
   - Safe mode toggle (False = research only, True = proposals allowed)
   - Human approval required for all changes

### Potential Gaps & Observations

#### Minor Issues

1. **Codex CLI Dependency**
   - The `run_scholar.bat` script uses `codex` CLI tool
   - Tool may not be in system PATH (expected if running within Cursor environment)
   - **Action**: Verify `codex` is available when executing, or document alternative execution method

2. **Coverage Checklist Inconsistency**
   - `gpt-instructions` shows as "In progress" but no corresponding dossier
   - May need verification or status update
   - **Action**: Review and update status if dossier exists elsewhere

3. **Missing Verification Reports**
   - STATUS.md shows verification_report exists but may not always be generated
   - **Action**: Ensure verification step runs consistently

#### Missing Features (Not Blockers)

1. **Session Log Analysis Automation**
   - Manual selection of logs for analysis
   - Could benefit from automated prioritization (newest, longest, most errors)
   - **Enhancement**: Add automated log selection in orchestrator

2. **Proposal Review Tracking**
   - 6 proposals in promotion_queue but no approval/rejection tracking
   - **Enhancement**: Add approval status field to proposals

3. **Research Notebook Organization**
   - Research entries are flat files with dates
   - Could benefit from topic-based organization
   - **Enhancement**: Add topic tags or subdirectories

#### Documentation Gaps

1. **Setup Instructions**
   - README.md explains what Scholar is but not how to set it up initially
   - Missing: Initial setup, codex installation, first-run guide
   - **Enhancement**: Add SETUP.md with initialization steps

2. **Execution Context**
   - Unclear if Scholar runs locally, in Cursor, or via CI/CD
   - **Enhancement**: Document execution environment requirements

## Current Priorities (From Coverage Checklist)

### Next Items to Process

1. **Concept Engine** — Not started (next priority per auto-selection policy)
2. **Frameworks (PEIRRO, KWIK)** — Not started
3. **Frameworks (Levels, H/M/Y)** — Not started
4. **gpt-instructions** — In progress (needs completion)

### Completed Items (Quality Examples)

- ✅ M0-M6 modules (all complete with dossiers)
- ✅ Runtime Prompt (complete)
- ✅ NotebookLM Bridge (complete)
- ✅ Brain Session Log Template (complete)
- ✅ Anatomy Engine (complete, high-quality dossier with evidence citations)

## Proposal Status

### Promotion Queue (6 proposals)

All proposals follow ONE-change-only rule and include evidence:

1. **Mastery Count** — Successive relearning tracking (RFC-20260107-004)
2. **Probe First** — Retrieval-before-explanation enforcement
3. **Semantic KWIK** — Enhanced keyword strategy

Each has corresponding experiment design for validation.

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

1. ✅ **Run Next Scholar Cycle** — Process Concept Engine (next in queue)
2. ✅ **Review Promotion Queue** — Evaluate 6 pending proposals for approval
3. ⚠️ **Verify gpt-instructions Status** — Check if dossier exists or mark as not started
4. ✅ **Continue Coverage** — System working as designed, continue auto-advancing

### Short-Term Enhancements

1. **Add Setup Documentation** — Create SETUP.md with initialization guide
2. **Proposal Tracking** — Add approval status to promotion queue items
3. **Log Prioritization** — Automate session log selection in orchestrator
4. **Research Organization** — Add topic tags to research notebook entries

### Long-Term Considerations

1. **Automated Testing** — Validate proposals against test session logs
2. **Metrics Dashboard** — Track coverage progress, proposal approval rates
3. **Integration Testing** — Validate approved proposals before production deployment

## Conclusion

**Scholar is production-ready and working effectively.** The system demonstrates:
- ✅ Clear architecture and separation of concerns
- ✅ Operational workflows producing quality artifacts
- ✅ Evidence-based research and proposals
- ✅ Proper guardrails preventing production modifications

**Next Step**: Run the next orchestrator cycle to process Concept Engine dossier, then review and prioritize promotion queue proposals.
