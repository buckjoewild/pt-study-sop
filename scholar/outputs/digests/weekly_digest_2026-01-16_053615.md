Here's my strategic analysis of the study system data:

**1. Executive Summary**
The study system shows active development with multiple improvement proposals in flight, but is experiencing execution blockers and gaps in core functionality. While there's healthy proposal generation (7 pending) and gap identification (15 documented), the presence of consistent blockers across recent runs and basic missing features like mastery tracking suggests the system needs fundamental stabilization before advancing new features.

**2. Top 3 Priority Actions**

1. **Fix Orchestrator Blockers**
   - Rationale: Three consecutive runs show blockers, indicating systemic issues
   - Action: Debug and resolve orchestrator failures before implementing new features
   - [tessl.io](https://tessl.io/blog/from-prompts-to-agents-md-what-survives-across-thousands-of-runs/) suggests using agent health monitoring patterns

2. **Implement Session Log Validation**
   - Rationale: Multiple gaps relate to log quality/completeness
   - Action: Create automated validation pipeline for session logs
   - Referenced in "Limited automated validation" gap

3. **Deploy Mastery Counter**
   - Rationale: Critical for successive relearning functionality
   - Action: Implement RFC-20260107-004 (Mastery Count tracking)
   - Links to identified gap in aggregate mastery tracking

**3. Proposals Review**

Most Impactful:
- "Successive Relearning Mastery Count" (RFC-20260107-004)
  - Addresses fundamental tracking gap
  - Enables data-driven learning paths
  - Should be prioritized

Concerns:
- Multiple concurrent proposals may split focus
- Need to validate Probe-First (RFC-20260107-002) impact on new learners
- Consider combining semantic KWIK changes with mastery tracking

**4. Research Recommendations**

1. **Session Log Quality Standards**
   - Research optimal validation rules
   - Based on multiple logging-related gaps
   - Use [deepwiki.com](https://deepwiki.com/SillyTavern/SillyTavern/6-context-and-memory-systems) patterns for context management

2. **Mastery Progression Metrics**
   - Define clear mastery level transitions
   - Support RFC-20260107-004 implementation
   - Include successive relearning patterns

3. **Probe-First Implementation Patterns**
   - Research exceptions for zero-exposure cases
   - Address unanswered questions about mandatory probing
   - Consider adaptive approaches based on learner state

**5. System Health Assessment**

Health Status: ACTIVE BUT UNSTABLE

Positive Indicators:
- Active proposal generation
- Thorough gap identification
- Clear research protocols

Concerns:
- Persistent orchestrator blockers
- Missing fundamental features (mastery tracking)
- Template/logging inconsistencies

Recommendations:
- Implement [google.github.io](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/agents/workflow-agents/loop-agents/) style workflow monitoring
- Focus on stabilizing core functionality before new features
- Add automated health checks and validation pipelines

The system shows healthy improvement activity but needs better execution stability and core feature completion before advancing new proposals.
