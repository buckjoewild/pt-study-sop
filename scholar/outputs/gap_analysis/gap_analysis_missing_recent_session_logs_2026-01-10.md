# Gap Analysis - Missing Recent Session Logs (2026-01-10)

## Problem framing
- No session logs exist in the audit window (2026-01-03 to 2026-01-10), so audit criteria cannot be evaluated.

## Evidence
- Latest log timestamps are 2025-12-13 (TEMPLATE/SAMPLE) and 2025-12-11 (last study session).
- No files in brain/session_logs are within the last 7 days.

## Constraints
- Read-only: sop/, brain/, dist/.
- Unattended: questions must be written to file.
- Outputs only in scholar/outputs/.
- Default scope: M0-M6 + bridges; no Promotion Queue.

## Options
1. Keep strict window; report "no data" and stop.
2. Define a fallback rule: if no logs in window, audit most recent prior session and flag staleness.

## Trade-offs
| option | pros | cons | risks | when to choose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | No scope creep; avoids stale inference | No audit signals; no technique checks | Missed regressions | If strict recency is required |
| 2 | Produces usable audit signal | Uses older data; may mislead | Overweights stale behavior | If continuous coverage is more valuable |

## Recommendation (one change)
- Adopt Option 2: add a fallback rule to audit the most recent prior log when the window is empty, and mark findings as stale.

## Impact if unaddressed
- Audits will repeatedly end with "no data" and cannot validate probe-before-teach or technique coverage.
