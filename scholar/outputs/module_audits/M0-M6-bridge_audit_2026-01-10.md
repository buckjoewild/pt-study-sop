# Module Audit - M0-M6 + Bridges (2026-01-10)

## Scope
- Window: 2026-01-03 to 2026-01-10 (last 7 days)
- Session logs in window: none
- Fallback used: most recent session log outside window for signal

## Sessions Reviewed (fallback)
1. 2025-12-11_geriatrics_normal_vs_common_abnormal.md (Core; Clin-Path v8)

## Findings
- Probe-before-teach: NOT met (AI-led due to zero prior exposure; no pre-instruction probe recorded)
- Friction pattern: Trigger vs mechanism confusion corrected during Sprint
- Strengths: L2 teach-back gating present; Sprint quizzes used; source-faithful anchors

## High-Utility Technique Checklist
- Retrieval practice: Present (Sprint quizzes after consolidation)
- Spaced practice: Not observed
- Elaborative interrogation: Not observed
- Self-explanation: Present (L2 teach-back before terminology)
- Interleaved practice: Not observed

## Recommendations (one change each)
1. Add a 60-second pre-probe in Core Mode even with zero exposure (allow "I don't know" responses) to satisfy probe-before-teach.

## Evidence
- brain/session_logs/2025-12-11_geriatrics_normal_vs_common_abnormal.md

## Limitations
- No session logs in the last 7 days; findings rely on the most recent prior session.
