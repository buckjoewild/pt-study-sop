## 1. Operational Contract
- Purpose: Practice with increasing difficulty, spacing, and variability to lock understanding and transfer.
- Trigger(s): After M3 encode; after misses in Sprint/Drill; when moving from guided to independent practice.
- Required Inputs: Encoded items or buckets, time available, mode, difficulty stage.
- Required Outputs: Retrieval practice across stages; error notes; readiness for wrap.
- Exit Criteria: Learner handles mixed/varied items with reasoning and completes spaced recalls of key items.
- Failure Modes / Drift Risks: Overload/fatigue, over-randomization, passive practice, error fossilization, confidence erosion.

## 2. Pedagogy Mapping
- Retrieval Practice: [PASS] - Frequent recall with feedback.
- Spacing/Interleaving: [PASS] - Explicit interleaving and spaced reinforcement.
- Cognitive Load: [PASS] - Progressive ladder and breaks manage load.
- Metacognition: [PARTIAL] - Error reflection exists; no explicit self-rating of confidence.

## 3. Evidence Map
- Successive relearning combines retrieval practice and spaced practice; items are practiced until correctly retrieved and then revisited in two or more subsequent sessions. (https://www.unh.edu/teaching-learning-resource-hub/sites/default/files/media/2023-06/itow-successive-relearning-dunlosky-greve-badali-wissman-rawson.pdf)
- Course studies cited in the guide used three or more sessions separated by at least one day and reported improved exam performance vs restudy.

## 4. Improvement Candidates (Rabbit Holes Allowed)
- Define a clear success criterion: one correct retrieval per item per session plus 2-3 spaced sessions across days.
- Add a "spacing marker" prompt to ensure start/mid/end re-tests of key items.

## 5. Promotion Candidates (MAX 3)
1. [Successive Relearning Criterion] Add a Build rule: each key item must be retrieved correctly once per session across at least 2 follow-up sessions.
2. [Spacing Markers] Add explicit in-session reminders (start/mid/end) to re-test key items.

## 6. Guardrails (What Must Not Change)
- PEIRRO ordering stays intact (Build follows Encode).
- Source-Lock remains mandatory for factual content.
- Difficulty ramp remains progressive (no skipping directly to Stage 3).
