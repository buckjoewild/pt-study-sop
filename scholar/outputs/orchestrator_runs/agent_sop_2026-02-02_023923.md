## Summary
SOP coverage is **not** complete and cannot be validated against the Master Plan because every allowlisted path is missing at its specified location. The Master Plan file is not present at `sop/MASTER_PLAN_PT_STUDY.md`, and most allowlisted SOPs only exist as archived copies under `sop/archive/`, while some are missing entirely. As a result, adherence to Master Plan contracts and testable requirements cannot be assessed from the provided allowlist.

```
Allowlist paths (sop/...) -> NOT FOUND
          |
          | filename matches
          v
     sop/archive/* (found)
     sop/library/* (canonical, not allowlisted)
```

## Coverage Gaps
- All allowlisted SOP files are missing at their specified paths under `sop/`, so no SOP content was reviewable in-place.
- `sop/MASTER_PLAN_PT_STUDY.md` is absent at the allowlisted path; only an archived copy exists at `sop/archive/MASTER_PLAN_PT_STUDY.md`.
- `sop/MASTER_REFERENCE_v9.2.md` is not found anywhere under `sop/`.
- Missing GPT-knowledge allowlist files with no matches under `sop/`: `sop/gpt-knowledge/gpt-instructions.md`, `sop/gpt-knowledge/runtime-prompt.md`, `sop/gpt-knowledge/notebooklm-bridge.md`, `sop/gpt-knowledge/brain-session-log-template.md`.
- Canonical SOP library (`sop/library/`) is not included in the allowlist, so current SOP contracts/invariants remain out of scope.

## Contract Mismatches
- No telemetry snapshot provided, so adherence vs observed behavior cannot be evaluated.
- No SOP content at allowlist paths, so contract-to-telemetry comparison is not possible.

## Questions Needed
- Should the audit use `sop/library/*` as the canonical SOP source instead of archived files?
- Is `sop/archive/MASTER_PLAN_PT_STUDY.md` the intended Master Plan for this audit, or is there a newer location?
- Are the missing GPT-knowledge files deprecated or relocated, and if so, where?
- Is `sop/MASTER_REFERENCE_v9.2.md` expected to be recreated, or has it been superseded?
