## Summary
Run `2026-02-02_023923` has no telemetry snapshot content, so system health is indeterminate. Expected flow: `Ingest -> Validate -> Aggregate -> Alerts`; with 0 records ingested in this run, I cannot confirm stability or detect anomalies. Treat this as a data-collection failure until a valid snapshot is provided.

## Signals
- Telemetry snapshot entries: 0 (snapshot missing).
- Metrics parsed: 0; anomalies detected: 0 (no data to analyze).

## Risks
- Monitoring blind spot could mask failures or regressions.
- Telemetry pipeline outage or misconfiguration may be blocking visibility across runs.
- “No anomalies” may be misread as healthy when data is absent.

## Questions Needed
- Can you provide the latest telemetry snapshot payload and its timestamp?
- What sources are expected in the snapshot (Brain logs, dashboard metrics, external services)?
- What are the alert thresholds or SLOs for the key metrics?

## Recommended Next Checks
- Verify the telemetry ingestion job executed for run `2026-02-02_023923` and confirm last successful run time.
- Pull raw telemetry files or database tables for this run and confirm record counts >0.
- Confirm snapshot generation path and permissions; re-run snapshot capture if empty.
- Cross-check system health via manual spot checks (service uptime, error logs, queue backlogs).
