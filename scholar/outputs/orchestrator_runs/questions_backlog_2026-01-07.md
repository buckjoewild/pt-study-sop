# Questions Backlog — RUN-20260107-EXAMPLE
- Auditor: The Scholar

## Active Questions
- [ ] **M1-Q1**: What is the physiological basis for the "Energy Check" threshold in medical student fatigue models?
  - *Source needed*: Academic study on trainee burnout/cognitive load.
- [ ] **M1-Q2**: How does the Tutor verify focus state beyond simple user self-reporting?
  - *Source needed*: HCI research on attention verification in e-learning.
- [ ] **M4-Q1**: In anatomy education, what is the optimal "Lead Time" between learning a structure and applying its clinical correlation?
  - *Source needed*: Meta-analysis on integrated vs. sequential clinical anatomy coaching.
- [ ] **M4-Q3**: What is evidence-based guidance on optimal within-session spacing (start/mid/end) for complex material?
  - *Source needed*: Empirical spacing/lag studies with short-term intervals.

## Answered Questions
- [x] **M1-Q3**: Should the focus/energy check be anchored to a validated sleepiness scale to calibrate thresholds?
  - *Evidence*: KSS provides a 1-9 anchored self-report scale and is sensitive to state sleepiness. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karolinska_Sleepiness_Scale
  - *Evidence*: KSS ratings track performance decrements with PVT in healthcare shift workers. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30874565/
- [x] **M4-Q2**: What evidence supports successive relearning across multiple sessions?
  - *Evidence*: Successive relearning combines retrieval practice and spaced practice, with two or more subsequent sessions and spaced sessions across days. https://www.unh.edu/teaching-learning-resource-hub/sites/default/files/media/2023-06/itow-successive-relearning-dunlosky-greve-badali-wissman-rawson.pdf
