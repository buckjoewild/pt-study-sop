# Scholar Orchestrator Run - 2026-01-09
- Run ID: 2026-01-09_024155
- Mode: Unattended
- Safe Mode: False (documentation/research only, no proposals)

## Actions Completed

1. **Initialized Run**
   - Created questions_needed_2026-01-09_024155.md (empty, as required)
   - Verified audit_manifest.json: safe_mode = false

2. **Selected Target**
   - Reviewed coverage_checklist_2026-01-08.md
   - Selected: **Concept Engine** (first "Not started" item)
   - Marked as "In progress" in coverage checklist

3. **Processed Concept Engine**
   - Read canonical source: sop/gpt-knowledge/concept-engine.md
   - Reviewed reference: sop/engines/concept-engine.md (deprecated)
   - Analyzed integration with M-series modules and runtime-prompt
   - Reviewed session logs for Concept Engine usage (found implicit usage in geriatrics session)
   - Evaluated against pedagogy audit rubric (10 categories)
   - Conducted research on Gagné/Merrill Component Display Theory foundation
   - Created comprehensive dossier: concept-engine_dossier_2026-01-09.md

4. **Updated Coverage Checklist**
   - Marked Concept Engine as [x] Complete
   - Created coverage_checklist_2026-01-09.md

## Artifacts Produced

1. **Module Dossier**: scholar/outputs/module_dossiers/concept-engine_dossier_2026-01-09.md
   - Operational contract documented
   - Pedagogy mapping: Retrieval Practice PASS, Spacing/Interleaving PARTIAL, Cognitive Load PASS, Metacognition PARTIAL, Transfer PASS, Discrimination PARTIAL
   - Evidence map with 6 research citations (CDT, Generation Effect, Elaborative Interrogation, Contrast Cases, Worked Examples, Cognitive Load Theory)
   - 7 improvement candidates (rabbit holes allowed)
   - 3 promotion candidates (ONE-change-only, safe_mode prevents generation)
   - Guardrails documented

2. **Coverage Checklist**: scholar/outputs/system_map/coverage_checklist_2026-01-09.md
   - Concept Engine marked complete
   - 12 items complete, 1 in progress, 2 not started

## Key Findings

- **Concept Engine Strengths**: Strong generation-first protocol, good cognitive load management, solid evidence base in CDT and learning science
- **Gaps Identified**: Missing pre-test checkpoint, weak error categorization, no explicit confidence calibration, limited interleaving support
- **Next Priority**: Frameworks (PEIRRO, KWIK) or Frameworks (Levels, H/M/Y) - both "Not started"

## Next Steps

1. Process next "Not started" item from coverage checklist (Frameworks group)
2. Continue auto-advancing through remaining coverage items
3. Note: safe_mode = false, so no promotion queue items generated (by design)

## Status

✅ Run completed successfully
✅ Mandatory artifact produced (module dossier)
✅ Coverage checklist updated
✅ No blockers encountered

# Scholar Orchestrator Run - 2026-01-09
- Run ID: 2026-01-09_024933
- Mode: Unattended
- Safe Mode: False (documentation/research only, no proposals)

## Actions Completed

1. **Initialized Run**
   - Created questions_needed_2026-01-09_024933.md (seeded, then updated with open questions)
   - Verified audit_manifest.json: safe_mode = false

2. **Refreshed System Map**
   - Created repo_index_2026-01-09.md (full tree scan for sop/, scholar/, brain/)
   - Updated coverage_checklist_2026-01-09.md source to repo_index_2026-01-09.md
   - Marked Frameworks (PEIRRO, KWIK) as In progress before processing

3. **Processed Frameworks (PEIRRO, KWIK)**
   - Read canonical sources: sop/gpt-knowledge/PEIRRO.md, sop/gpt-knowledge/KWIK.md
   - Reviewed integration points: M3-encode, runtime-prompt, gpt-instructions, M5-modes
   - Completed web research on testing effect, elaborative interrogation, dual-coding theory, spacing effect, and overlearning
   - Created dossier: peirro-kwik_dossier_2026-01-09.md

4. **Updated Coverage Checklist**
   - Marked Frameworks (PEIRRO, KWIK) as [x] Dossier complete

## Artifacts Produced

1. **Repo Index**: scholar/outputs/system_map/repo_index_2026-01-09.md
   - Full repository index refreshed

2. **Coverage Checklist**: scholar/outputs/system_map/coverage_checklist_2026-01-09.md
   - Frameworks (PEIRRO, KWIK) marked complete

3. **Module Dossier**: scholar/outputs/module_dossiers/peirro-kwik_dossier_2026-01-09.md
   - Operational contract for PEIRRO and KWIK
   - Pedagogy mapping across 9 categories
   - Evidence map with research links and citations
   - Improvement and promotion candidates (no promotion queue items due to safe_mode)

4. **Questions Needed**: scholar/outputs/orchestrator_runs/questions_needed_2026-01-09_024933.md
   - Logged open questions on Overlearn scheduling, Refine error typing, and KWIK lock storage

## Key Findings

- **Strengths**: Clear learning-cycle backbone (PEIRRO) with explicit retrieval step; KWIK provides a rigorous, function-first encoding flow with gating.
- **Gaps**: No explicit spacing/interleaving inside PEIRRO/KWIK; Refine lacks standardized error typing; metacognition relies on resonance only (no confidence calibration).
- **Risk**: KWIK drift if function-first or resonance gating is skipped, or if used outside Encode.

## Next Steps

1. Process next "Not started" item: Frameworks (Levels, H/M/Y)
2. Consider standardizing Refine error typing and Overlearn scheduling once approved

## Status

- Run completed successfully
- Mandatory artifacts produced
- Coverage checklist updated

# Scholar Orchestrator Run - 2026-01-09
- Run ID: 2026-01-09_auto
- Mode: Unattended
- Safe Mode: False (documentation/research only, no proposals)

## Actions Completed

1. **Initialized Run**
   - Created questions_needed_2026-01-09.md (empty, as required)

3. **Selected Target**
   - Reviewed coverage_checklist_2026-01-09.md
   - Selected: **Frameworks (Levels, H/M/Y)** (first "Not started" item)
   - Marked as "In progress" before processing

4. **Processed Frameworks (Levels, H/M/Y)**
   - Read canonical sources: sop/gpt-knowledge/levels.md, H-series.md, M-series.md, Y-series.md
   - Produced dossier: frameworks_levels_hmy_dossier_2026-01-09.md
   - No external research performed; relied on repo sources only

5. **Updated Coverage Checklist**
   - Marked Frameworks (Levels, H/M/Y) as [x] Dossier complete

## Artifacts Produced

1. **Repo Index**: scholar/outputs/system_map/repo_index_2026-01-09.md
2. **Coverage Checklist**: scholar/outputs/system_map/coverage_checklist_2026-01-09.md
3. **Module Dossier**: scholar/outputs/module_dossiers/frameworks_levels_hmy_dossier_2026-01-09.md

## Key Findings

- Levels enforce L2 teach-back gating before clinical depth; Core/Sprint examples show how to enforce the gate.
- H/M/Y frameworks emphasize concise structured outputs with defaults (H1, M2) and quick orientation options (Y series).

## Next Steps

1. Resume the remaining in-progress item: Infrastructure (gpt-instructions).

## Status

- Run completed successfully
- Mandatory artifacts produced
