# Scholar Orchestrator Run - 2026-01-10
- Run ID: 2026-01-10_auto
- Mode: Unattended
- Safe Mode: False (documentation/research only, no proposals)

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Audit recent session logs (last 7 days or since last run).
2. Apply Probe-Before-Teach and High-Utility Technique checklist.
3. Produce one artifact (audit report or dossier).
4. Update run log with required sections and weekly digest if triggered.
5. Respect read-only guardrails for sop/, brain/, dist/.

## Actions Completed
1. Initialized run
   - Created questions_needed_2026-01-10.md
   - Verified audit_manifest.json: safe_mode = false
2. Audited session logs
   - Window: 2026-01-03 to 2026-01-10
   - No session logs in window; reviewed most recent fallback log (2025-12-11)
3. Phase 2 Research
   - Skipped new web research (no new unknowns beyond existing SOP guidance)
4. Synthesized artifact
   - Created audit report for M0-M6 + bridges
5. Weekly digest
   - Triggered (Saturday); created weekly_digest_2026-01-10.md

## Artifacts Produced
1. Audit Report: scholar/outputs/module_audits/M0-M6-bridge_audit_2026-01-10.md
2. Questions Needed: scholar/outputs/orchestrator_runs/questions_needed_2026-01-10.md
3. Weekly Digest: scholar/outputs/reports/weekly_digest_2026-01-10.md

## Status
- Run completed
- Mandatory artifact produced
- Read-only paths respected (sop/, brain/, dist/)

### What I Learned This Run (5 bullets max)
- No session logs in the last 7 days; audit relied on the most recent prior session.
- Probe-before-teach was skipped in the fallback session due to zero prior exposure.
- L2 teach-back and Sprint quizzes remain reliable strengths in Core Mode.
- Mechanism vs action confusion still emerges before Sprint corrections.
- Technique coverage outside retrieval/self-explanation is limited in recent evidence.

### Action Items
- ⚡ Confirm whether Core Mode requires a minimal pre-probe even with zero prior exposure.

### Warnings
- ⚠️ No session logs within the last 7 days; findings based on a 2025-12-11 fallback session.

# Scholar Orchestrator Run - 2026-01-10 (auto_2)
- Run ID: 2026-01-10_auto_2
- Mode: Unattended
- Safe Mode: UNCONFIRMED (audit_manifest.json not found; assumed false)

## Actions Completed
1. Audited session logs
   - Window: 2026-01-03 to 2026-01-10
   - No session logs in window; no fallback used
2. Phase 2 Research
   - Skipped (no research questions triggered)
3. Synthesized artifact
   - Created gap analysis for missing recent logs
4. Weekly digest
   - Triggered (Saturday); appended weekly_digest_2026-01-10.md

## Artifacts Produced
1. Gap Analysis: scholar/outputs/gap_analysis/gap_analysis_missing_recent_session_logs_2026-01-10.md
2. Weekly Digest (update): scholar/outputs/reports/weekly_digest_2026-01-10.md

## Status
- Run completed
- Mandatory artifact produced
- Read-only paths respected (sop/, brain/, dist/)

### What I Learned This Run (5 bullets max)
- No session logs exist within the last 7 days, so audit checks are not applicable.
- Technique coverage and probe-before-teach compliance cannot be evaluated without recent logs.
- Missing audit_manifest.json requires defaulting safe_mode to false.
- Gap analysis suggests a fallback audit rule when the window is empty.

### Action Items
- ⚡ Decide whether to adopt the fallback audit rule when the audit window is empty.

### Warnings
- ⚠️ No session logs within the audit window; results limited to data availability.
- ⚠️ audit_manifest.json not found; safe_mode assumed false.

4. Update run log with required sections; weekly digest if triggered.
5. Respect read-only guardrails for sop/, brain/, dist/.

## Actions Completed
1. Audited session logs
   - Window: 2026-01-03 to 2026-01-10
   - No session logs in window; strict window (no fallback)
2. Phase 2 Research
   - Skipped (no research questions triggered)
3. Synthesized artifact
   - Created module audit for M0-M6 + bridges
4. Weekly digest
   - Triggered (Saturday); weekly_digest_2026-01-10.md already exists; not regenerated

## Artifacts Produced
1. Module Audit: scholar/outputs/module_audits/M0-M6-bridge_audit_2026-01-10_auto_3.md

## Status
- Run completed
- Mandatory artifact produced
- Read-only paths respected (sop/, brain/, dist/)

### What I Learned This Run (5 bullets max)
- No session logs exist within the last 7 days, so the audit remains non-evaluative.
- Probe-before-teach and technique checklist compliance cannot be assessed without logs.
- Strict-window audits should include a clear empty-window signal to avoid false inference.

### Action Items
- ⚡ Add a daily audit gate that flags empty 7-day windows in session logs.

### Warnings
- ⚠️ No session logs within the audit window; findings are limited to data availability.
