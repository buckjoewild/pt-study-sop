# Scholar Orchestrator Run - 2026-01-12

- Run ID: 2026-01-12_auto
- Mode: Unattended
- Safe Mode: False (audit_manifest.json)

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Audit recent session logs (last 7 days or since last run).
2. Apply Probe-Before-Teach and High-Utility Technique checklist.
3. Produce one artifact for M0-M6 + bridges.
4. Update run log with required sections; weekly digest only if triggered.
5. Respect read-only guardrails for sop/, brain/, dist/.

## Actions Completed
1. Initialized run
   - Created questions_needed_2026-01-12.md
   - Verified audit_manifest.json: safe_mode = false
2. Audited session logs
   - Window: 2026-01-05 to 2026-01-12
   - No session logs in window; fallback sample used (2025-12-05 to 2025-12-11)
3. Phase 2 Research
   - Skipped (no external research questions triggered)
4. Synthesized artifact
   - Created module audit for M0-M6 + bridges
5. Weekly digest
   - Not triggered (last digest 2026-01-11)

## Artifacts Produced
1. Module Audit: scholar/outputs/module_audits/M0-M6-bridge_audit_2026-01-12.md
2. Questions Needed: scholar/outputs/orchestrator_runs/questions_needed_2026-01-12.md

## Status
- Run completed
- Mandatory artifact produced
- Read-only paths respected (sop/, brain/, dist/)

### What I Learned This Run (5 bullets max)
- No session logs in the last 7 days; audit used a 2025-12-05 to 2025-12-11 fallback.
- Retrieval practice and self-explanation appear in a subset of sessions, but spaced practice and elaborative interrogation are not evidenced.
- Probe-before-teach is not documented; one session explicitly notes AI taught first due to zero prior exposure.
- Repeated requests for image-first and one-step gating suggest the anatomy workflow still needs stronger enforcement cues.
- Template-only logs and duplicate session records continue to dilute audit signal.

### Action Items
- ? Decide whether fallback audits should remain the default when the 7-day window is empty.
- ? Clarify whether teach-first is permitted when there is zero prior exposure.
- ? Confirm whether template-only logs should be blocked at ingest.

### Warnings
- ?? No session logs within the last 7 days; findings rely on a 2025-12-05 to 2025-12-11 fallback.
- ?? Template-only logs and duplicate session records reduce audit quality.
