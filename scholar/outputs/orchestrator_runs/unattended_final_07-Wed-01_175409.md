Completed the unattended M0–M6+bridge loop by modeling M1/M4, adding evidence-backed research notes, and updating the run log, questions backlog, and coverage checklist without touching `sop/`, `brain/`, or `dist/`.

- New dossiers with evidence maps and bounded promotion candidates: `scholar/outputs/module_dossiers/M1-entry_dossier_2026-01-07.md`, `scholar/outputs/module_dossiers/M4-build_dossier_2026-01-07.md`
- New research notes with citations (KSS anchors, KSS/PVT performance, successive relearning spacing): `scholar/outputs/research_notebook/M1_research_2026-01-07_sleepiness.md`, `scholar/outputs/research_notebook/M4_research_2026-01-07_successive_relearning.md`
- Questions backlog updated with answered items and one open spacing question: `scholar/outputs/orchestrator_runs/questions_backlog_2026-01-07.md`
- Run log appended for this iteration: `scholar/outputs/orchestrator_runs/run_2026-01-07_M0-M6-bridge.md`
- Coverage checklist updated to reflect M1/M4/M5 dossier completion: `scholar/outputs/system_map/coverage_checklist_2026-01-07.md`

Next steps if you want them:
1) I can run a focused web search to answer M4-Q3 (within-session spacing/lag guidance) and close it in the backlog.
2) I can split the combined M1/M4/M5 row in `scholar/outputs/system_map/coverage_checklist_2026-01-07.md` into individual module lines for clearer tracking.
