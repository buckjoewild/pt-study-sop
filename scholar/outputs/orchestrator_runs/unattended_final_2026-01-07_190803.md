Completed the unattended cycle: refreshed the repo index and coverage checklist, selected runtime-prompt as the next uncompleted module, and produced a dossier with an evidence map and improvement candidates (no promotion-queue artifacts because safe_mode is false).  
- Repo index and coverage updates: `scholar/outputs/system_map/repo_index_2026-01-07.md`, `scholar/outputs/system_map/coverage_checklist_2026-01-07.md`  
- Dossier output: `scholar/outputs/module_dossiers/runtime-prompt_dossier_2026-01-07.md`  
- Run log with scope and sources: `scholar/outputs/orchestrator_runs/run_2026-01-07.md`

Next steps (pick one):
1. Continue the next uncompleted module (Anatomy Engine or Concept Engine) in the next run.
2. Review the runtime prompt dossier and decide whether to open a promotion candidate once safe_mode is enabled.
3. Prioritize gpt-instructions completion to align the runtime prompt with NotebookLM source-locking.
