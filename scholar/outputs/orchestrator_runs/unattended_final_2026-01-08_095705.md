Refreshed the system map and coverage checklist, then produced the Anatomy Engine dossier with evidence citations per the unattended runbook.

- Updated the full-tree repo index (UTF-8 to preserve legacy non-ASCII filenames) in `scholar/outputs/system_map/repo_index_2026-01-08.md`.
- Marked Anatomy Engine complete in the coverage tracker in `scholar/outputs/system_map/coverage_checklist_2026-01-08.md`.
- Added the Anatomy Engine dossier (contract, pedagogy mapping, evidence map) in `scholar/outputs/module_dossiers/anatomy-engine_dossier_2026-01-08.md`.
- Logged the run actions and next scope per policy in `scholar/outputs/orchestrator_runs/run_2026-01-08.md`.
- Tests not run (not requested).

Next steps:
1. Run the next unattended cycle to process Concept Engine (next Not started).
2. If you want deeper coverage, I can add a focused research note on interleaving/spaced practice for anatomy sessions.
