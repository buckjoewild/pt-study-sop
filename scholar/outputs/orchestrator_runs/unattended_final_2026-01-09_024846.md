Completed the unattended orchestrator run: refreshed the repo index and coverage checklist, audited PEIRRO/KWIK, and logged the dossier and run artifacts.

- New system map index at `scholar/outputs/system_map/repo_index_2026-01-09.md` (full sop/scholar/brain scan).
- Coverage updated in `scholar/outputs/system_map/coverage_checklist_2026-01-09.md` with PEIRRO/KWIK marked complete.
- Dossier created at `scholar/outputs/module_dossiers/peirro-kwik_dossier_2026-01-09.md` (operational contract, pedagogy mapping, evidence map, candidates, guardrails).
- Run log appended in `scholar/outputs/orchestrator_runs/run_2026-01-09.md`; open questions captured in `scholar/outputs/orchestrator_runs/questions_needed_2026-01-09_024933.md`.

Next steps you may want:
1) Process the next “Not started” item: Frameworks (Levels, H/M/Y).
2) Review and resolve the open questions in `scholar/outputs/orchestrator_runs/questions_needed_2026-01-09_024933.md`.
3) If desired, translate one dossier candidate into a formal proposal once safe_mode is enabled.
