Scholar execution requested (Run ID: 2026-01-09_040513)

Since 'codex' CLI is not available, Scholar needs to be executed via Cursor IDE.

TO EXECUTE:
1. In Cursor IDE, open: scholar/workflows/orchestrator_run_prompt.md
2. Copy the entire file content
3. Paste into Cursor AI chat and request execution
   OR use Cursor's AI chat on the file directly
4. The orchestrator will handle preserved questions automatically
