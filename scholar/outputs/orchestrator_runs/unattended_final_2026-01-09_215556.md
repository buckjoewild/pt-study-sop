**Ledger Snapshot**
- Goal: Execute Scholar Orchestrator unattended runbook for pt-study-sop with required artifacts and logs.
- Now/Next: Await next unattended run; next would process Infrastructure (gpt-instructions) if continuing.
- Open Questions: None.

**Acceptance Criteria**
- Read `scholar/workflows/orchestrator_loop.md` and `scholar/inputs/audit_manifest.json`.
- Initialize run paths and create empty questions file.
- Refresh repo index and coverage checklist.
- Select first Not started scope and produce a mandatory artifact outside `orchestrator_runs/`.
- Append run summary and update checklist statuses.

**Problem Framing**
- Unattended run required a fresh system map and coverage advance without touching `sop/`, `brain/`, or `dist/`.

**Constraints**
- Non-interactive; questions go to questions file only.
- `safe_mode=false` so no Promotion Queue artifacts.
- Read-only for `sop/`, `brain/`, `dist/`.

**Options**
- Create a Module Dossier.
- Create a Module Audit.
- Create a Research Note.

**Trade-offs**
| Option | Pros | Cons | Risks | When to choose |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Module Dossier | Fast, structured, aligns with checklist | Less depth than audit | Shallow coverage | When checklist needs completion |
| Module Audit | Deeper analysis | More time | Run budget overrun | When high-risk module |
| Research Note | Focused evidence | Doesn’t advance checklist status alone | Checklist stalls | When unknowns dominate |

**Recommendation + Why**
- Proceeded with a Module Dossier for Frameworks (Levels, H/M/Y) to satisfy the mandatory artifact rule and close the remaining Not started item quickly under safe_mode=false constraints.

**Work Completed**
- Refreshed repo index: `scholar/outputs/system_map/repo_index_2026-01-09.md`.
- Updated checklist and marked Frameworks (Levels, H/M/Y) complete: `scholar/outputs/system_map/coverage_checklist_2026-01-09.md`.
- Created dossier: `scholar/outputs/module_dossiers/frameworks_levels_hmy_dossier_2026-01-09.md`.
- Logged run summary: `scholar/outputs/orchestrator_runs/run_2026-01-09.md`.
- Questions file initialized (none): `scholar/outputs/orchestrator_runs/questions_needed_2026-01-09.md`.
- Tests not run (doc-only outputs).

**Facts / Assumptions / Recommendations**
- Facts (repo): Levels/H/M/Y framework definitions live in `sop/gpt-knowledge/*.md`.
- Assumptions: No external research required for this run; repo sources are sufficient.
- Recommendations: If continuing, process Infrastructure (gpt-instructions) next.

**Follow-ups**
1. Continue the unattended cycle for Infrastructure (gpt-instructions).
2. If desired, allow a research note for Y-series examples before proposing any changes.
