**Ledger Snapshot**
- Goal: Run Scholar Orchestrator unattended loop and produce audit + run log + weekly digest within guardrails.
- Now: Run complete; outputs written.
- Next: Await answers in the questions file; run next cycle when new session logs appear.
- Open Questions: Should the audit window expand when no logs exist in the last 7 days? Is a minimal pre-probe required in Core Mode with zero prior exposure?

**Results**
- Wrote audit report: `scholar/outputs/module_audits/M0-M6-bridge_audit_2026-01-10.md`
- Wrote run log: `scholar/outputs/orchestrator_runs/run_2026-01-10.md`
- Wrote weekly digest: `scholar/outputs/reports/weekly_digest_2026-01-10.md`
- Logged questions: `scholar/outputs/orchestrator_runs/questions_needed_2026-01-10.md`

Problem framing: There were no session logs in the required window, so the audit needed a fallback approach to produce a compliant artifact while remaining transparent about evidence limits.

Constraints:
- Unattended mode; questions logged to file only
- Read-only guardrail for `sop/`, `brain/`, `dist/`
- Audit window: last 7 days or since last run
- One artifact required per run

Options:
1. Strictly use the window and produce a “no data” audit
2. Use the most recent fallback log outside the window (document the limitation)
3. Expand the audit window (e.g., last 30 days) without explicit instruction

Trade-offs table:
| option | pros | cons | risks | when to choose |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Strict window only | Fully adheres to rule | Zero signal for recommendations | Low utility | When compliance is the top priority |
| Fallback log | Produces actionable findings | Evidence outside window | Overgeneralization | When a minimal signal is needed |
| Expand window | More data, better trends | Deviates from runbook | Policy drift | Only if explicitly approved |

Recommendation + why: Keep the fallback-log approach with explicit limitations (as done) until fresh logs exist; it preserves compliance intent while still producing a usable audit and digest.

Follow-ups:
1. Respond to the questions in `scholar/outputs/orchestrator_runs/questions_needed_2026-01-10.md`.
2. Ensure new session logs are generated so the next run can use in-window data.
