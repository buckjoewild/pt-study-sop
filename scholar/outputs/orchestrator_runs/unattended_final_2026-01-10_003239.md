Ledger Snapshot
- Goal: Run Scholar Orchestrator unattended per runbook.
- Now: Run complete; gap analysis, run log update, and weekly digest update written.
- Next: Await direction on whether to adopt a fallback audit rule and how to handle missing `audit_manifest.json`.
- Open Questions: recorded in `scholar/outputs/orchestrator_runs/questions_needed_2026-01-10_003316.md`.

Completed the unattended orchestrator run with a gap analysis because there were no session logs in the last 7 days, then appended today’s run log and weekly digest to capture the data gap.

Acceptance Criteria (applied)
- Audit last 7 days of `brain/session_logs` (found none in window).
- Flag probe-before-teach and technique coverage when logs exist (not applicable).
- Produce one artifact in `scholar/outputs` (gap analysis).
- Update run log with required end sections.
- Write questions to a `questions_needed_<run>.md` file when needed.

Files created/updated
- Created `scholar/outputs/gap_analysis/gap_analysis_missing_recent_session_logs_2026-01-10.md`.
- Appended `scholar/outputs/orchestrator_runs/run_2026-01-10.md`.
- Appended `scholar/outputs/reports/weekly_digest_2026-01-10.md`.
- Created `scholar/outputs/orchestrator_runs/questions_needed_2026-01-10_003316.md`.

Decision Summary
- Problem framing: No session logs exist within the required 7-day audit window, so the audit rules cannot be applied.
- Constraints: Read-only for `sop/`, `brain/`, `dist/`; unattended; outputs only in `scholar/outputs`; default scope M0–M6 + bridges.
- Options:
  1. Keep strict window and report no data.
  2. Add a fallback rule to audit the most recent prior log and mark findings stale.
- Trade-offs:
| option | pros | cons | risks | when to choose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | No scope creep; avoids stale inference | No audit signal | Missed regressions | If strict recency is required |
| 2 | Produces usable signal | Uses older data | Stale conclusions | If continuity matters more |
- Recommendation + why: Option 2, because it preserves audit continuity while explicitly marking staleness.
- Follow-ups:
  1) If you want, I can draft a formal fallback rule in `scholar/outputs` for future runs.  
  2) If you want, I can create or locate `audit_manifest.json` to formalize `safe_mode`.
