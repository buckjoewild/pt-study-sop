Ledger Snapshot: Goal: run unattended Scholar Orchestrator (audit logs, optional research, produce artifact, update run log). Now: strict-window audit completed with no logs; artifact created; run log appended. Next: await new logs/instructions. Open Questions: none.

Created a strict-window M0–M6 + bridges audit for the empty 7‑day window and appended a new run entry to today’s log; weekly digest already exists for 2026‑01‑10 so it was not regenerated.

- New artifact: `C:\Users\treyt\OneDrive\Desktop\pt-study-sop\scholar\outputs\module_audits\M0-M6-bridge_audit_2026-01-10_auto_3.md`
- Run log updated: `C:\Users\treyt\OneDrive\Desktop\pt-study-sop\scholar\outputs\orchestrator_runs\run_2026-01-10.md`
- Inputs used: `C:\Users\treyt\OneDrive\Desktop\pt-study-sop\scholar\inputs\audit_manifest.json` (safe_mode false), no logs in `C:\Users\treyt\OneDrive\Desktop\pt-study-sop\brain\session_logs\` for 2026‑01‑03 to 2026‑01‑10

Next steps (optional):
1. Review the recommendation in the new audit and decide whether to implement the daily empty-window audit gate.
