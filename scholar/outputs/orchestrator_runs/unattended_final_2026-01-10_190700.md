Ledger Snapshot
Goal: UNCONFIRMED — `CONTINUITY.md` now shows a tutor_engine refactor goal that conflicts with this Scholar Orchestrator run.
Now: Paused to resolve the unexpected ledger change.
Next: Await your direction on whether to restore the ledger to the orchestrator run state.
Open Questions: Should I reconcile `CONTINUITY.md` to this run’s state?

Completed the unattended run and wrote outputs:
- Gap analysis: `scholar/outputs/gap_analysis/gap_analysis_missing_recent_session_logs_2026-01-10_190911.md`
- Run log update: `scholar/outputs/orchestrator_runs/run_2026-01-10.md`
- Questions file: `scholar/outputs/orchestrator_runs/questions_needed_2026-01-10_190911.md`
- Weekly digest update: `scholar/outputs/reports/weekly_digest_2026-01-10.md`

I noticed `CONTINUITY.md` changed to an unrelated goal after I started; I did not overwrite it. How would you like me to proceed with the ledger?

If you want, I can:
1) Reconcile and update `CONTINUITY.md` to reflect this orchestrator run.
2) Run a follow-on audit once new session logs are available.
