Ledger Snapshot: Goal: run Scholar Orchestrator unattended and produce required outputs; Now: prepare run summary; Next: await further instructions; Open Questions: None.

Completed the unattended Scholar Orchestrator run for 2026-01-10 with a strict 7-day audit window; no recent session logs were found, so I produced a gap analysis and updated the run log and weekly digest to reflect the empty window.
- Created the gap analysis artifact at `scholar/outputs/gap_analysis/gap_analysis_missing_recent_session_logs_2026-01-10_201637.md` to document the missing-log gap and a single recommended change.
- Appended the new run entry (auto_5) with required sections to `scholar/outputs/orchestrator_runs/run_2026-01-10.md`.
- Appended the weekly digest update for this run to `scholar/outputs/reports/weekly_digest_2026-01-10.md`.
- Audit window check confirmed no session logs in the last 7 days, so probe-before-teach and technique checks were not applicable.

Tests not run (not applicable to these documentation outputs).

Next steps (optional):
1. Add a new session log so the next audit window has data.
2. Re-run the orchestrator once new logs exist to enable full checklist evaluation.
