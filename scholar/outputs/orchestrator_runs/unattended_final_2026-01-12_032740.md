Ledger Snapshot — Goal: run the unattended Scholar Orchestrator audit and outputs; Now: run summary prepared; Next: await next run instructions; Open Questions: see `scholar/outputs/orchestrator_runs/questions_needed_2026-01-12.md`.

Completed the unattended Scholar Orchestrator run for 2026-01-12 using the fallback sample (no logs in the 7-day window), and produced the required module audit, run log, and questions file; updated `CONTINUITY.md`.

Acceptance criteria used:
1) Audit recent session logs (last 7 days or since last run).
2) Apply Probe-Before-Teach and High-Utility Technique checklist.
3) Produce one artifact for M0-M6 + bridges.
4) Update the run log with required sections; weekly digest only if triggered.
5) Respect read-only guardrails for `sop/`, `brain/`, `dist/`.

Outputs:
- `scholar/outputs/module_audits/M0-M6-bridge_audit_2026-01-12.md`
- `scholar/outputs/orchestrator_runs/run_2026-01-12.md`
- `scholar/outputs/orchestrator_runs/questions_needed_2026-01-12.md`
- `CONTINUITY.md`

Notes: Research skipped (no external research questions triggered); weekly digest not triggered; read-only guardrails respected. Tests not run (not applicable for doc-only outputs).

Problem framing: No recent session logs exist in the last-7-day window, but the runbook still requires a single artifact and run log.
Constraints:
- Unattended mode with questions logged to file.
- Read-only guardrails on `sop/`, `brain/`, `dist/`.
- Defaults to M0-M6 + bridges; no promotion queue with `safe_mode: false`.
- Outputs must land under `scholar/outputs/`.

Options:
- Produce a run log only and mark the audit as no-data.
- Use the latest available fallback sample to complete the audit.
- Stop and write a blocker until new logs appear.

Trade-offs:
| option | pros | cons | risks | when to choose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| run log only | strict data purity | no audit signal | loses trend continuity | if fallback is disallowed |
| fallback sample | preserves audit signal | not current window | stale insights | when continuity is preferred |
| blocker | enforces freshness | no artifact | stalls cadence | when current data is mandatory |

Recommendation + why: Use the fallback sample (as done) to preserve continuity and keep the audit cadence intact while explicitly flagging the stale window in the run log.

Follow-ups:
1) Review the audit and run log; confirm policy decisions recorded in `scholar/outputs/orchestrator_runs/questions_needed_2026-01-12.md`.
2) Decide whether to implement the proposed session log template and ingest checks in the next maintenance window.
3) Trigger the next run after new session logs arrive to avoid fallback sampling.
