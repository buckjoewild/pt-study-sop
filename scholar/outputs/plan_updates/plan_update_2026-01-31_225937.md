## Priority Actions (from digest)
- Implement Probe-First Gating (RFC-20260107-002) first - this foundational change will improve all subsequent learning flows
- Execute Mastery Count Tracking experiment (EXP-20260107-004) - critical for measuring learning outcomes
- Review and finalize Semantic-Lead KWIK Flow proposal - enhances encoding efficiency based on cognitive science principles

## Proposal Signals (from digest)
- (none found)

## Research Follow-ups (from digest)
- Investigate real-time feedback integration based on [openreview.net](https://openreview.net/attachment?id=xm6vXYVH3i&name=pdf) duplex model findings
- Study systematic evaluation methods per [braintrust.dev](https://www.braintrust.dev/docs/core/experiments) framework
- Research optimal mastery threshold levels

## System Health Notes (from digest)
- Multiple active improvement proposals
- Good mix of experimental and architectural changes
- All proposals from same date (Jan 7) suggesting possible process bottleneck
- Need more continuous proposal flow
- May benefit from more granular tracking of implementation status
