## Priority Actions (from run)
- ACTION: Locate and attach the telemetry snapshot for run `2026-02-02_023923` to restore observability.
- ACTION: Verify telemetry ingestion job execution and confirm non-zero records for this run to ensure data validity.
- ACTION: Confirm canonical SOP sources for audit (likely `sop/library/`) and update the allowlist to match.
- ACTION: Resolve missing SOP files (`sop/MASTER_PLAN_PT_STUDY.md`, `sop/MASTER_REFERENCE_v9.2.md`, `sop/gpt-knowledge/*`) by restoring or formally deprecating them.
- ACTION: Define minimum telemetry events mapped to SOP steps and pedagogy rubrics so audits can proceed.

## System Health Notes (from run)
- WARN: “No anomalies” cannot be interpreted as healthy when telemetry is absent.
- WARN: SOP compliance cannot be assessed while allowlisted paths are missing.
- WARN: Pedagogy rubric scoring is not possible without evidence signals.

## Improvement Questions
- What single change would most improve the Tutor loop next run?
- What bottleneck is causing the most friction in sessions?
- Which module has the weakest evidence coverage?

## Plan Targets

- `sop/gpt-knowledge/M0-planning.md`
