## Navigation reachability notes
Evidence: `brain/templates/dashboard.html` top nav + legacy nav.

- Top nav includes tabs: overview, syllabus, sessions, scholar, tutor.
- `tab-brain` (Brain Database) and `tab-sync` exist but only appear in legacy nav markup (not in top nav).
- Sync and Brain Database are likely not reachable in the current top-nav UI unless legacy sidebar is enabled.

## Non-routed appendix
- `brain/templates/styleguide.html` is present but not routed in `routes.py` (no `/styleguide` endpoint). It can serve as a UI reference appendix.
