# Module Audit - M0-M6 + Bridge (2026-01-07)
- Auditor: The Scholar
- Scope: M0, M2, M3, M5, M6, notebooklm-bridge
- Inputs: Existing module dossiers dated 2026-01-07
- Method: Dossier review and cycle-level consistency check (no SOP edits).

## Module Models (Condensed)
### M0 Planning
- Purpose: Establish targets, source-lock, and pre-test gate before cognitive work.

- Guardrails: Source-lock; planning fields compatible with log schema.

### M2 Prime
- Purpose: Map territory and bucket before encoding.
- Key outputs: 2-4 buckets, first bucket selected for M3.
- Guardrails: Source-lock; PEIRRO ordering preserved.

### M3 Encode
- Purpose: Convert information into durable cues (seed + hook + function).
- Key outputs: Locked items in bucket with seed, hook, function.
- Guardrails: Seed-lock; source-lock for clinical facts.

### M5 Modes
- Purpose: Behavior presets to match energy and readiness.
- Key outputs: Mode applied to PEIRRO cycle.
- Guardrails: Seed-lock and source-lock always enforced.

### M6 Wrap
- Purpose: Consolidate, capture errors, and schedule reviews.
- Key outputs: Log artifact, cards, spaced review dates.
- Guardrails: Log schema and Google Tasks integration unchanged.

### NotebookLM Bridge
