# Research Note - M1: Focus/Energy Self-Report Anchors
- Date: 2026-01-07
- Researcher: The Scholar
- Status: Complete

## 1. Question / Rabbit Hole
Can M1's "Focus level 1-10" and "Energy/motivation" check be anchored to a validated alertness scale, and do self-report ratings track performance?

## 2. Why it matters for Tutor/SOP
M1 uses low/high thresholds without anchors. Aligning with a validated scale can justify thresholds and improve mode recommendations.

## 3. Findings Summary
- The Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS) is a 1-9 state measure with verbal anchors from "extremely alert" to "very sleepy," providing a concrete mapping for subjective alertness.
- In shift-working healthcare staff, higher KSS ratings coincided with worse psychomotor vigilance test (PVT) reaction times, suggesting subjective sleepiness tracks objective performance decrements.
- Implication: Map the 1-10 focus check to KSS-style anchors (e.g., 1-3 alert, 7-9 sleepy) and use high sleepiness as a trigger for shorter sessions or lighter modes.
