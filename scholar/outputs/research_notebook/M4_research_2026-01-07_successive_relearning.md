# Research Note - M4: Successive Relearning and Spaced Retrieval
- Date: 2026-01-07
- Researcher: The Scholar
- Status: Complete

## 1. Question / Rabbit Hole
What evidence supports M4's "successive relearning" guidance (multiple correct recalls across spaced sessions)?

## 2. Why it matters for Tutor/SOP
M4 instructs spacing and successive relearning but lacks explicit evidence and timing guidance.

## 3. Findings Summary
- The educator guide defines successive relearning as combining retrieval practice and spaced practice; within a session, items are practiced until correctly retrieved, then revisited in two or more subsequent sessions.
- Course studies cited in the guide used three or more sessions separated by at least one day and reported improved exam performance over restudy, reinforcing the value of repeated retrieval across days.
- Implication: M4 can set a criterion of one correct retrieval per session and schedule 2-3 spaced sessions across days, rather than only within-session repetition.
