# Ralph Progress Log
Started: 2026-01-12

## Codebase Patterns
- Proposal approvals: dashboard API moves files from `scholar/outputs/promotion_queue/` to `scholar/outputs/proposals/approved` or `scholar/outputs/proposals/rejected` and records them in `brain/data/pt_study.db` (`scholar_proposals`).
- Questions lifecycle: `scholar/outputs/orchestrator_runs/questions_needed_*.md` is the primary queue; `scholar/outputs/STATUS.md` points to the latest questions file.
- Scholar coverage notes should reference `scholar/outputs/system_map/scholar_inventory_*.md` to claim full lane coverage.
- System health schemas should include per-system required subsections with evidence anchors and priority-ranked improvements.

## 2026-01-12 - US-001
- What was implemented: Authored Scholar loop contract with artifact inventory, loop feed mapping, and cadence details.
- Files changed: `scholar/outputs/reports/scholar_loop_contract_2026-01-12.md`, `scripts/ralph/prd.json`, `scripts/ralph/progress.txt`, `AGENTS.md`, `CONTINUITY.md`
- **Learnings:**
  - Patterns discovered: Loop contracts should map questions, proposals, gaps, digests, and system health to explicit file paths and loop phases.
  - Gotchas encountered: Linux `python`/`pytest` were missing; ran checks via Windows `cmd.exe` Python instead.
---
## 2026-01-12 - US-002
- What was implemented: Defined the system health schema with per-system templates, evidence anchors, and coverage note.
- Files changed: `scholar/outputs/reports/system_health_schema_2026-01-12.md`, `scripts/ralph/prd.json`, `scripts/ralph/progress.txt`, `AGENTS.md`, `CONTINUITY.md`
- **Learnings:**
  - Patterns discovered: Health schemas should require evidence paths for every subsection to keep system summaries auditable.
  - Gotchas encountered: WSL `python` lacked pytest; ran checks via Windows `cmd.exe` Python instead.
---
## 2026-01-12 - US-003
- What was implemented: Authored the system health report covering Brain, Tutor, Scholar, Dashboard/Loop, and Telemetry/Data with evidence paths and a lane coverage note.
- Files changed: `scholar/outputs/reports/system_health_2026-01-12.md`, `scripts/ralph/prd.json`, `scripts/ralph/progress.txt`, `AGENTS.md`, `CONTINUITY.md`
- **Learnings:**
  - Patterns discovered: System health reports should include evidence paths in every subsection and a coverage note referencing the latest scholar inventory.
---
## 2026-01-12 - US-004
- What was implemented: Mapped the Scholar questions lifecycle with generation, storage, answering flow, downstream usage, and gaps, plus a lane coverage note.
- Files changed: `scholar/outputs/reports/questions_lifecycle_2026-01-12.md`, `scripts/ralph/prd.json`, `scripts/ralph/progress.txt`, `AGENTS.md`, `CONTINUITY.md`
- **Learnings:**
  - Patterns discovered: The questions queue lives in `scholar/outputs/orchestrator_runs/questions_needed_*.md` with STATUS pointing to the latest questions file.
  - Gotchas encountered: WSL `python` is missing; use `cmd.exe /c python` for required checks.
---
## 2026-01-12 - US-005
- What was implemented: Authored the proposals lifecycle report covering drafting, queueing, approval/rejection, downstream usage, and gaps with evidence paths.
- Files changed: `scholar/outputs/reports/proposals_lifecycle_2026-01-12.md`, `scripts/ralph/prd.json`, `scripts/ralph/progress.txt`, `AGENTS.md`, `CONTINUITY.md`
- **Learnings:**
  - Patterns discovered: Proposal approvals are routed through the dashboard API, which updates markdown Status, moves files into approved/rejected folders, and records them in `brain/data/pt_study.db`.
  - Gotchas encountered: `scholar/inputs/ai_artifacts_manifest.json` only targets `scholar/outputs/proposals/*.md`, so approved/rejected subfolders are not tracked unless patterns are expanded.
---
---
## 2026-01-12 - US-006
- What was implemented: Authored digests lifecycle report covering generation, storage, usage, and gaps.
- Files changed: `scholar/outputs/reports/digests_lifecycle_2026-01-12.md`, `scripts/ralph/prd.json`, `scripts/ralph/progress.txt`, `CONTINUITY.md`
- **Learnings:**
  - Patterns discovered: Digest save flow writes to `scholar/outputs/digests/` and also creates plan_updates + proposal_seeds plus a DB record in `scholar_digests`.
  - Gotchas encountered: Digest generation and digest saving are separate endpoints; plan updates only happen on save.
---
## 2026-01-12 - US-007
