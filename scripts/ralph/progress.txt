# Ralph Progress Log
Started: 2026-01-12

## Codebase Patterns
- Scholar outputs: keep artifacts organized under scholar/outputs by lane (reports, module_audits, module_dossiers, gap_analysis, digests, orchestrator_runs, research_notebook, promotion_queue, system_map).
- Migrations: Use IF NOT EXISTS
- Types: Export from actions.ts

## Key Files
- brain/README.md
- scripts/release_check.py

## 2026-01-12 - US-001
- What was implemented: Created Scholar audit report with inventory, connections map, expected vs actual behavior, gaps/risks, and open questions.
- Files changed: scholar/outputs/audit_scholar_repo.md; AGENTS.md; scripts/ralph/progress.txt.
- **Learnings:**
  - Scholar outputs are organized by lane under scholar/outputs; document deviations when they occur.
  - Gotchas encountered: WSL missing python/pip/pytest; python -m pytest failed; python3 -m pytest failed (pytest missing); pip/ensurepip unavailable; python3 scripts/release_check.py timed out and exited nonzero.
