# Research Index

## Purpose
This document tracks artifact-anchored research and refinement status so study SOP updates stay organized and evidence-based.

## Artifact Inventory
| File | Layer (Learning / Execution / Enforcement / Measurement) | Cognitive Job (one sentence, inferred from file name and docs) | Explicit or Implicit? (Explicit / Implicit / Missing) | Research Status (Not started / In progress / Complete) | Change Status (None / Candidate / Implemented) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| sop/gpt-knowledge/PEIRRO.md | Learning | Defines the core Prepare-Encode-Interrogate-Retrieve-Refine-Overlearn learning sequence. | Explicit | Not started | None |
| sop/gpt-knowledge/KWIK.md | Learning | Details the Sound→Function→Image→Resonance→Lock encoding flow for term hooks. | Explicit | Not started | None |
| sop/modules/M0-planning.md | Execution | Outlines the planning stage steps before study sessions begin. | Explicit | Not started | None |

## Refinement Rules
- Changes require an identified gap, supporting research, and an explicit decision before updating any artifact.
- Recording “no change” is acceptable when evidence supports the current state.

## Stopping Criteria
- An artifact is considered done for refinement when its intended layer and cognitive job are validated, open research questions are closed or deferred with rationale, and no pending change candidates remain.
