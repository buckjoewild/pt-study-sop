# SOP Research Status (v9.1)

## Completed Research Notes
- Modules:  
  - M0-planning (`modules/M0-planning-research.md`)  
  - M2-prime (`modules/M2-prime-research.md`)  
  - M3-encode (`modules/M3-encode-research.md`)  
  - M4-build (`modules/M4-build-research.md`)  
  - M5-modes (`modules/M5-modes-research.md`)  
  - M6-wrap (`modules/M6-wrap-research.md`)

## Recommended Next Research Targets
- Frameworks: H-series, M-series, Levels — evidence on mapping/hierarchical org, when to choose which framework for novice vs. intermediate learners.
- Methods (deep dives/quick refs):
  - Drawing for anatomy (labeled vs unlabeled, guided drawing, spatial memory).
  - Desirable difficulties (spacing/interleaving/variability) in health-sci contexts.
  - Elaborative interrogation & self-explanation (health-sci examples, effect sizes).
  - Metacognition/calibration (JOLs, confidence-based scoring).
  - Retrieval practice quick-reference (for easy reuse in methods).
- Engines/Content:
  - Anatomy Engine: visual landmark training, discrimination of similar structures, image-based/AR/VR anatomy learning.
  - Recap Engine: structured recap/exam wrappers/post-lesson quiz evidence for a recap workflow.

## Integration To-Do (after research)
- Pull key “Toolkit / Evidence / Risks” sections from each module research file into the live module docs (M0, M2–M6).
- Add crosswalks and decision rules (e.g., mode switching thresholds, framework selection) into `MASTER.md`.
- Update runtime prompt with prime (pre-test) reminder and wrap (mark unverified) note.
- Add spacing/next-step templates to M6; add fading/ramp templates to M4; add mode rules to M5.

## Notes
- Research files are meant as scratch pads. When integrating, keep module files concise and keep citations handy.  
- Prioritize short wrap formats (2–10 min) and micro/standard session timing guidance as already captured in module research.
