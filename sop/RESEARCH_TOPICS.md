# Research Priorities (lean list)

## Tier 1 (work through first)
1) Testing Effect / Retrieval Practice (Roediger, Karpicke) — fuel Sprint/Drill design.
2) Cognitive Load Theory (Sweller) — chunking, Gated Platter limits, extraneous load trim.
3) Dual Coding / Multimedia Learning (Paivio, Mayer) — drawing protocol, landmarks-first.
4) Levels of Processing / Elaborative Interrogation (Craik & Lockhart) — Seed-Lock depth.
5) Spacing & Interleaving (Cepeda, Kornell) — dashboard spacing alerts, content scheduling.

## Tier 2 (next pass)
6) Metacognition & Calibration (Dunlosky, Bjork) — confidence vs performance charts.
7) Desirable Difficulties (Bjork) — generation, varied practice, reduced cues.
8) Feedback Timing & Specificity (Hattie/Timperley) — gate design, prompt timing.
9) Schema Theory / Prior Knowledge Activation — priming/bucketing refinements.
10) Transfer & Analogical Learning — build better hooks/seed prompts and cross-topic bridges.

## How to use
- Pick 1 topic/week; read 2–3 papers or solid summaries.
- Update the relevant methods/framework file and test in one session.
- Log impact notes in `sop/working/PLAN_v9.2_dev.md`.


## Status / Completed Research
# SOP Research Status (v9.1)

## Completed Research Notes
- Modules:  
  - M0-planning (`modules/M0-planning-research.md`)  
  - M2-prime (`modules/M2-prime-research.md`)  
  - M3-encode (`modules/M3-encode-research.md`)  
  - M4-build (`modules/M4-build-research.md`)  
  - M5-modes (`modules/M5-modes-research.md`)  
  - M6-wrap (`modules/M6-wrap-research.md`)

## Recommended Next Research Targets
- Frameworks: H-series, M-series, Levels â€” evidence on mapping/hierarchical org, when to choose which framework for novice vs. intermediate learners.
- Methods (deep dives/quick refs):
  - Drawing for anatomy (labeled vs unlabeled, guided drawing, spatial memory).
  - Desirable difficulties (spacing/interleaving/variability) in health-sci contexts.
  - Elaborative interrogation & self-explanation (health-sci examples, effect sizes).
  - Metacognition/calibration (JOLs, confidence-based scoring).
  - Retrieval practice quick-reference (for easy reuse in methods).
- Engines/Content:
  - Anatomy Engine: visual landmark training, discrimination of similar structures, image-based/AR/VR anatomy learning.
  - Recap Engine: structured recap/exam wrappers/post-lesson quiz evidence for a recap workflow.

## Integration To-Do (after research)
- Pull key â€œToolkit / Evidence / Risksâ€ sections from each module research file into the live module docs (M0, M2â€“M6).
- Add crosswalks and decision rules (e.g., mode switching thresholds, framework selection) into `MASTER.md`.
- Update runtime prompt with prime (pre-test) reminder and wrap (mark unverified) note.
- Add spacing/next-step templates to M6; add fading/ramp templates to M4; add mode rules to M5.

## Notes
- Research files are meant as scratch pads. When integrating, keep module files concise and keep citations handy.  
- Prioritize short wrap formats (2â€“10 min) and micro/standard session timing guidance as already captured in module research.
