# Metacognition

## What It Means
"Thinking about your thinking." The ability to monitor your own learning process, evaluate your understanding, and make good decisions about what to study.

---

## Two Components

### 1. Monitoring
Evaluating your current cognitive state:
- "How well do I know this?"
- "Is this making sense?"
- "Am I ready for the test?"

### 2. Control
Making decisions based on monitoring:
- "I should study this more"
- "I can move on from this topic"
- "I need a different approach"

## The Calibration Problem

**Calibration:** How well your confidence matches your actual performance.

Most students are **poorly calibrated:**
- Overconfident on weak areas
- Underconfident on strong areas
- Can't accurately predict test performance

**Why it matters:** Poor calibration → bad study decisions → wasted time on wrong topics.

---

## Signs of Poor Calibration

- "I knew this but I forgot it on the test" (recognition ≠ recall)
- "I studied so much but still failed" (re-reading ≠ learning)
- "I thought I understood but couldn't explain it" (familiarity ≠ understanding)
- Surprise at test grades (either direction)

---

## Improving Calibration

### 1. Test Yourself Before You Feel Ready
Don't wait until you "feel" prepared. Test early to discover actual gaps.

**In this system:** Sprint mode tests immediately. Fail-first reveals what you don't know.

### 2. Explain in Your Own Words
Recognition fools you. Retrieval reveals truth.

**In this system:** Teach-back at L2 forces production, not recognition.

### 3. Seek Feedback
External validation corrects internal illusions.

**In this system:** AI validates your Seeds and explanations. Mold command troubleshoots.

### 4. Track Over Time
Single-point assessment is noisy. Patterns are clearer.

**In this system:** Brain logs sessions. Dashboard shows patterns. Resume tracks progress.

## Self-Monitoring Questions

### Before Study Session
- What do I already know about this?
- What specifically am I trying to learn?
- How will I know when I've learned it?

### During Study Session
- Is this making sense?
- Can I explain this simply?
- What am I struggling with?

### After Study Session
- What did I learn?
- What's still unclear?
- How confident am I, really?

## Application in This System

| Metacognitive Skill | System Feature |
|---------------------|----------------|
| Monitoring understanding | L2 teach-back, self-ratings |
| Identifying gaps | Sprint mode reveals misses |
| Planning what to study | Brain dashboard shows weak areas |
| Evaluating strategies | What Worked / What Needs Fixing in logs |
| Calibrating confidence | Confidence ratings vs actual performance |

---

## The Brain Analytics Purpose

The Brain tracking system serves metacognition:

**Session Logs Capture:**
- What you studied
- How you rated your understanding
- What worked and what didn't

**Dashboard Provides:**
- Topic coverage map (what's missing?)
- Confidence vs performance trends (calibration)
- Patterns in struggles (systemic issues?)
- Readiness assessment (how prepared are you?)

---

## Key Insight

**You are not a good judge of your own learning in the moment.**

This isn't a flaw — it's universal. That's why the system:
- Forces retrieval (reveals true knowledge)
- Tracks over time (patterns emerge)
- Requires external validation (AI checks understanding)
