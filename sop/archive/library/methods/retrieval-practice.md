# Retrieval Practice

## What It Means
Using your memory to produce information, rather than re-exposing yourself to it. Testing yourself, not reviewing.

---

## The Testing Effect

When you retrieve information from memory, you strengthen that memory. The act of retrieval itself is the learning event.

**Re-reading:** See → Recognize → "I know this" (illusion)  
**Retrieval:** Cue → Search → Produce → Strengthen (actual learning)

---

## Why It Works

### Retrieval Strengthens Memory
Every successful retrieval makes future retrieval easier. You're training the retrieval pathway, not just the storage.

### Retrieval Reveals Gaps
You can't fake retrieval. Either you know it or you don't. Re-reading hides gaps behind familiarity.

### Retrieval Mimics Real Use
On the exam, you must produce. Studying should match the demand.

---

## The Illusion of Knowing

Students often feel they know material because they recognize it when re-reading. But recognition ≠ recall.

**Recognition:** "Yes, I've seen this before" (easy)  
**Recall:** "Here's what I know about this" (hard, but what tests require)

Sprint mode forces recall. You can't recognize an answer to "What prevents anterior tibial translation?" — you have to produce "ACL."

## How to Practice Retrieval

### 1. Close the Book
Don't look at material while trying to remember it. That's not retrieval — that's recognition plus copying.

### 2. Attempt Before Looking
Try to recall first, even if you fail. Failed retrieval attempts still help learning (the "pretesting effect").

### 3. Check and Correct
After attempting retrieval, verify accuracy. Correct errors immediately.

### 4. Space Your Practice
Don't retrieve repeatedly in one session. Space retrieval across time for maximum benefit.

## Retrieval Formats

| Format | Difficulty | Benefit |
|--------|------------|---------|
| Free recall | High | Best for retention |
| Cued recall | Medium | Good for structured knowledge |
| Recognition (MCQ) | Low | Better than nothing |

**In this system:** Seed-Lock and teach-back use free/cued recall. Sprint mode uses cued recall. These are harder than MCQ but more effective.

---

## Sprint Mode = Retrieval Practice

Sprint mode is structured retrieval practice:

```
AI asks (cue) → User produces (retrieval) → Check → Next
```

**When correct:** Retrieval strengthened. Move on.  
**When wrong:** Gap revealed. Build hook. Retry.

Sprint doesn't teach. Sprint tests. Teaching only happens when retrieval fails.

---

## Failed Retrieval Is Valuable

The "hypercorrection effect": When you're confident but wrong, the correction sticks better than if you had no opinion.

**Implication:** Don't avoid testing yourself on uncertain material. Wrong answers that get corrected are well-remembered.

**In Sprint mode:** Misses trigger phonetic hook building. The miss + correction creates durable memory.

## Compared to Re-reading

| | Re-reading | Retrieval Practice |
|-|------------|--------------------|
| Feels like | "I'm learning!" | "This is hard" |
| Actually is | Familiarity illusion | Active encoding |
| Reveals gaps | No | Yes |
| Strengthens memory | Weakly | Strongly |
| Time efficiency | Poor | Excellent |

---

## Application in This System

| Feature | Retrieval Practice |
|---------|-------------------|
| Seed-Lock | User produces hook from memory |
| L2 Teach-back | User explains without prompts |
| Sprint Mode | Pure retrieval-test cycle |
| Anki Cards | Spaced retrieval practice |

## Key Insight

**The struggle to remember is the learning.**

If retrieval feels easy, you're not building much. If retrieval feels hard, you're strengthening the memory.

This is a desirable difficulty. Embrace it.
