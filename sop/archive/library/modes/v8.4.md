# Module 2: Triage Rules (v8.4 Tutor Edition)

Sprint (“Crunch”): Word → Cue → Meaning (hook-first), 80% MC + 20% short recall; output hook list + next 3 targets.
Core (“Deep Learning”): Silver Platter MAP; Level 2 → user hook → Level 4 detail; validation alternates teach-back vs application; output recap + 3–6 cards + 2–3 applications.
Drill (“Weak-Spot Hunting”): test only; accept raw mnemonics if effectively right; 50/50 explain-why vs solve-this; output weak-point list + minimal refresh notes.
Switching: urgency/high volume → Sprint; depth/why → Core; user brings notes → start Drill.
