# M2 Prime – Research Notes (v9.1)

Scope: Priming/activation before study; works across subjects, with notes for PT/anatomy and other domains.

## Key Findings
- Pre-questions / pretesting improve later learning even when answers are initially wrong; effects seen across texts, lectures, and videos (meta g≈0.54 for targeted content). Benefits require feedback.
- Benefits are content-specific: prequestions mainly boost the material they target; minimal spillover to unrelated content.
- Errorful generation is desirable if feedback follows; struggling heightens attention and curiosity.
- Feedback timing matters: immediate feedback for facts; short-delay is acceptable for richer materials, but no feedback can nullify the effect.
- Prior-knowledge activation (1–2 min brain dump) primes schemas and surfaces misconceptions.
- Visual generation (labeling unlabeled images/models) improves anatomy recall; medical students labeling echo images before answers retained more at 6–9 months than those who viewed labeled images.
- Priming warms up motivation: learners report higher enjoyment/satisfaction after pretesting versus passive study.

## Prime Toolkit (1–3 min techniques)
- Pre-question quiz: 2–4 targeted MCQ/short-answer items on today’s core points.
- Brain dump: 60–120s free recall of what’s known/assumed about the topic.
- Label-a-diagram: unlabeled image/model → learners fill labels from memory (great for anatomy/spatial topics).
- Prediction prompt: ask for a predicted outcome/attachment/function before teaching.
- K/W (from KWL): list what they Know and Want-to-know; finish L later.

## Difficulty & Feedback Guidelines
- Aim for “Goldilocks” difficulty: challenging but not impossible; use hints/MCQ if novices are blanking.
- Provide feedback quickly; for factual items, reveal answers immediately after attempts.
- Normalize errors: frame guesses as low-stakes; reinforce good reasoning even when wrong.
- Guard against misconceptions: never leave primes unanswered—always correct and explain.

## Timing
- 30–60 min session: 5–10 min priming (≈10–15% of time) then move into instruction/practice.
- 10–15 min micro-session: 1–2 min single high-impact prime (one question or quick recall) then straight to learning.

## Risks & Mitigations
- Frustration/anxiety → make primes low-stakes; allow anonymous or pair discussion; reassure errors are expected.
- Negative suggestion (wrong answers stick) → immediate correction and brief explanation.
- Wasted time / overlong primes → keep brief and aligned to core objectives; don’t over-prime trivial details.
- Narrow focus → ensure prime questions hit central concepts; explicitly flag other key points during lesson.
- Wide prior-knowledge spread → use results to guide emphasis, not to splinter the group; address common misconceptions for all.

## Placement Plan
- Add “Prime Toolkit” + “Evidence” sections to `M2-prime.md`.
- Insert timing and feedback guidance into the module.
- Add anatomy-specific examples (blank labels, landmark recall) in the module’s examples section.
