# Codex Prompt: Merge Study Blueprint into SOP

Task:
- Integrate rotation, sandwich ingestion, spaced retrieval, exit ticket, and metrics into canonical SOP modules.
- Fact-check overclaims and reframe as heuristics when citations are missing.
- Update runtime prompts/instructions to reference the latest logging schema.
- Create/refresh master docs and prompt artifacts.
- Do not delete files; archive deprecated items and leave pointers.

Required outputs:
- New/updated master files at sop/ root (blueprint summary, rotation system, exit ticket/metrics, logging schema).
- Updated M0/M2/M3/M6 modules.
- Runtime prompts aligned to logging schema.
- Final report: created/modified/archived files and consistency checklist.
