# Content Libraries (Planned)

Staging area for subject-specific content libraries that feed the study engines.

Suggested structure:
- `anatomy/` — hierarchies, images, drills
- `pathology/` — conditions, patterns, clinical scripts
- `foundations/` — cross-cutting skills, test-taking patterns

Each subfolder should include source references, curation notes, and export formats usable by GPT knowledge files or future DB-backed engines.
