# Study Engines (Planned)

Home for specialized engine specs (e.g., pathology engine, exam-prep engine) that extend the core SOP modules.

Starter layout:
- `templates/` — common prompt/flow templates for new engines
- `pathology/` — draft prompts, heuristics, and scoring for pathology-focused sessions
- `exam_prep/` — timing, block construction, and feedback rules for practice exams

Document each engine with entry prompts, state machine/phase notes, scoring/gating rules, and how it integrates with the Brain.
