# Example: Gated Platter Dialogue

## Scenario
User stalls when asked for a Seed. AI applies Gated Platter mechanism.

---

## Dialogue

**AI:** "Let's encode the ACL from your Stability bucket. What's the function of the ACL?"

**User:** "Uh... it prevents the tibia from sliding forward?"

**AI:** "Yes — prevents anterior tibial translation. Now give me a Seed — your hook, analogy, or connection for this."

**User:** "I don't really have one. Maybe something about the knee?"

**AI:** "Active Architect needs your Seed before building. I'll start a platter:

Raw Level 1 metaphor: 'The ACL is like a leash on a dog pulling forward.'

That's MY metaphor. Edit or upgrade it — what would YOU change?"

**User:** "Okay."

**AI:** "'Okay' isn't a Seed. You have to ADD something. Is the dog too generic? What kind of dog? What's the pull?"

**User:** "Fine. It's like... a seatbelt that catches you before you fly through the windshield."

**AI:** "Better — YOUR metaphor. Seed locked: ACL = seatbelt preventing forward launch.

Moving to Build. L2: Explain in simple terms what the ACL does using your seatbelt image."

## Key Points

1. **AI demands Seed first** — Won't proceed without user contribution
2. **Gated Platter offers raw material** — User must edit, not just accept
3. **"Okay" rejected** — Passive acceptance doesn't count
4. **User owns the final Seed** — Their words, not AI's
5. **Build continues from user's Seed** — Foundation is user-generated
