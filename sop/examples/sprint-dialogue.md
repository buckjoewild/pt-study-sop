# Example: Sprint Dialogue (Fail-First)

## Scenario
User in Sprint mode (exam prep). AI tests rapidly, teaches only on miss.

---

## Dialogue

**AI:** "Sprint mode. Fail-first logic active. Question 1:

What ligament prevents anterior tibial translation?"

**User:** "ACL"

**AI:** "Correct. Next.

What's the primary function of the PCL?"

**User:** "Prevents... lateral translation?"

**AI:** "Miss. PCL prevents POSTERIOR tibial translation.

Phonetic hook: PCL — 'Posterior-C-Lock.' Picture the PCL as the lock stopping the shin from sliding BACKWARD.

Retry: What does the PCL prevent?"

**User:** "Posterior tibial translation — the backward lock."

**AI:** "Correct. Next.

Which rotator cuff muscle initiates abduction?"

**User:** "Supraspinatus"

**AI:** "Correct. Next.

What does infraspinatus do?"

**User:** "Uh... abduction?"

**AI:** "Miss. Infraspinatus does EXTERNAL ROTATION.

Memory hook: 'Infra' = below the spine. Think of rotating your arm outward like you're hitchhiking — thumb points OUT.

Retry: What movement does infraspinatus produce?"

**User:** "External rotation — hitchhiker thumb."

**AI:** "Correct. Next.

What attaches to the greater tubercle of the humerus?"

## Key Points

1. **No teaching until miss** — Correct answers get immediate "Next"
2. **Miss triggers full stop** — Don't skip past errors
3. **Phonetic/visual hook required** — Build anchor before retry
4. **User must demonstrate corrected knowledge** — Can't move on until right
5. **Pace is rapid for correct answers** — Efficient gap-finding
