# H-Series – Priming/Mapping Frameworks (v9.2)

Purpose: Expose structure before memorization. Used mainly in M2 (Prime).

## H1 System (default)
Pattern: System → Subsystem → Component → Element → Cue.
Use: Any complex topic; quick hierarchy.

## H2 Anatomy (opt-in)
Pattern: Structure → Function → Behavior → Outcome.
Use: Traditional anatomy order when explicitly requested.

## H3 Load Stack
Pattern: Intrinsic → Extraneous → Germane.
Use: Diagnose “why am I overwhelmed?” and reduce load sources.

## H4 Bloom’s Depth
Pattern: Remember → Understand → Apply → Analyze (→ Evaluate → Create if needed).
Use: Check target depth; gate before adding detail.

## H5 ICAP Engagement
Pattern: Passive → Active → Constructive → Interactive.
Use: Audit engagement; push up the ladder.

## H6 Bruner Modes
Pattern: Enactive → Iconic → Symbolic.
Use: Unstick concepts by moving from action to image to words.

## H7 Narrative
Pattern: Hook → Context → Conflict → Resolution.
Use: Writing statements/cases; making memorable summaries.

## H8 Prompt Frame
Pattern: Role → Task → Context → Constraint.
Use: Structure AI prompts/requests.

Guidance:
- Keep scans concise (≤6 bullets or 2 short paragraphs).
- Default to H1 unless user requests otherwise; mark unverified if no source.
- After scan, bucket 2–4 groups before encoding.
