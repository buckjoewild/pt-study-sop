# KWIK - Core Learning Module
Version: v1.0
Status: Canonical

# Purpose
The Kwik method anchors memory hooks by moving from a phonetic cue through function-focused meaning into imagery and a locked artifact to reinforce encoding.

# Core Flow
1. Sound - Capture a phonetic seed or sound-alike hook for the term.
2. Function - State the true function or action to ground meaning before visuals.
3. Image - Build imagery tied directly to the confirmed function.
4. Resonance - Confirm the hook "sounds right" and "feels right" with the learner.
5. Lock - Record the hook (card/log) only after resonance is confirmed.

# Constraints (Must / Never)
- Must pair Word + Meaning before imagery to trigger accurate hooks.
- Must follow the Sound -> Function -> Image -> Lock order for Kwik encoding.
- Must gate each step (Sound, Function, Image, Resonance, Lock) and only advance with user approval.
- Must keep imagery function-first; create images only after stating true action/function.
- Must perform a resonance check before locking any hook or Seed-Lock.
- Must log a lock (card/hook) before moving past the Lock step.
- Must apply the phonetic override for complex or new terms by asking what they sound like before defining meaning.
- Never advance to the next stage without the required confirmation for the current step.
- Never skip the resonance confirmation when securing a Seed-Lock or final hook.

# Outputs
- Resonance-confirmed phonetic hook tied to function and imagery.
- Locked artifact such as a card or recorded hook entry after confirmation.

# When to Use
- During M3 Encode when turning mapped buckets into memory hooks using the Kwik flow.
- When encountering complex or new terms that need a sound-alike hook before meaning.
- Whenever a Seed-Lock or card is being created and must be gated through resonance.
- When enforcing function-first, dual-code encoding that requires imagery tied to meaning.

# Scope & Boundaries
- INCLUDE: Use KWIK to encode difficult terms, labels, anatomy structures, and symbols.
- INCLUDE: Require meaning/function before imagery.
- INCLUDE: Use multimodal cues (verbal + visual) to create retrieval anchors.
- INCLUDE: Use KWIK during Encode only.
- LIMIT: State-setting and focus aids are allowed only if brief and directly tied to starting Encode.
- LIMIT: Mnemonics allowed only after basic understanding is demonstrated.
- LIMIT: Speed-reading techniques allowed only for Prepare/preview, not deep encoding.
- EXCLUDE: Memorizing without understanding.
- EXCLUDE: Creating imagery during Retrieve or testing phases.
- EXCLUDE: Motivational or inspirational rituals not tied to immediate study action.
- EXCLUDE: Over-elaborate mnemonic construction that delays progress.

## Evidence Signals
- Helping: Fast recall with correct meaning.
- Helping: Imagery reliably triggers function/context.
- Hurting: Image recalled but meaning forgotten.
- Hurting: Confusion between similar items.
- Hurting: Overconfidence without retrieval success.
