# KWIK — Core Learning Module
Version: v1.0
Status: Canonical

# Purpose
The Kwik method anchors memory hooks by moving from a phonetic cue through function-focused meaning into imagery and a locked artifact to reinforce encoding.

# Core Flow
1. Sound — Capture a phonetic seed or sound-alike hook for the term.
2. Function — State the true function or action to ground meaning before visuals.
3. Image — Build imagery tied directly to the confirmed function.
4. Resonance — Confirm the hook “sounds right” and “feels right” with the learner.
5. Lock — Record the hook (card/log) only after resonance is confirmed.

# Constraints (Must / Never)
- Must pair Word + Meaning before imagery to trigger accurate hooks.
- Must follow the Sound → Function → Image → Lock order for Kwik encoding.
- Must gate each step (Sound, Function, Image, Resonance, Lock) and only advance with user approval.
- Must keep imagery function-first; create images only after stating true action/function.
- Must perform a resonance check before locking any hook or Seed-Lock.
- Must log a lock (card/hook) before moving past the Lock step.
- Must apply the phonetic override for complex or new terms by asking what they sound like before defining meaning.
- Never advance to the next stage without the required confirmation for the current step.
- Never skip the resonance confirmation when securing a Seed-Lock or final hook.

# Outputs
- Resonance-confirmed phonetic hook tied to function and imagery.
- Locked artifact such as a card or recorded hook entry after confirmation.

# When to Use
- During M3 Encode when turning mapped buckets into memory hooks using the Kwik flow.
- When encountering complex or new terms that need a sound-alike hook before meaning.
- Whenever a Seed-Lock or card is being created and must be gated through resonance.
- When enforcing function-first, dual-code encoding that requires imagery tied to meaning.

# Scope & Boundaries
- Use KWIK to encode difficult terms, labels, anatomy, or symbols that need durable recall.
- Require meaning/function before imagery; imagery must stay tied to the confirmed function.
- Combine verbal and visual cues to create retrieval anchors.
- Apply KWIK only during Encode.
- Motivation or state-setting is allowed only when brief and directly tied to Encode.
- Mnemonics are allowed only after understanding is demonstrated.
- Speed-reading techniques are for Prepare previewing, not for deep Encode steps.
- Do not use KWIK to memorize without understanding.
- Do not create imagery during Retrieve or testing phases.
- Do not use motivation rituals or inspirational content as substitutes for study.
- Avoid over-elaborate mnemonic construction that delays learning progress.

## Evidence Signals
- Helping: fast, meaningful recall where imagery triggers the correct function.
- Hurting: recalling an image without meaning, confusing similar items, or feeling confident without retrieval success.
