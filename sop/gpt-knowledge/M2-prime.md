# M2: Prime (v9.2 dev)

Purpose: Map the territory before encoding. Build buckets; don’t memorize yet.

---
## Protocol (fast)
1) H1 scan (default): System → Subsystem → Component → Element (2 short paragraphs or ≤6 bullets).
2) Buckets: Ask the user to group into 2–4 buckets (spatial/mechanism/compare/contrast/workflow/timeline).
3) Select bucket to encode first.
4) (Optional) H2 (structure-first) only if user requests traditional anatomy order.

---
## Toolkit
- Pre-question/brain dump (1–3 items) if not already done in planning.
- Label-a-diagram prime: show unlabeled schema (or ask learner to draw blanks); have them label from memory, then reveal/correct.
- Prediction prompt: “What do you think happens/attaches/functions here?” before teaching.

---
## Guardrails
- Don’t teach details during prime; keep it a map.
- Keep scans tight; mark unverified if no source provided.
- Bucket first, then encode; 2–3 buckets max for a session.

---
## Exit Condition
- H-series scan done; buckets chosen; first bucket selected; pre-questions answered and corrected; ready for M3 (Encode).
