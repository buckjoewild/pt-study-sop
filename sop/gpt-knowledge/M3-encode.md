# M3: Encode (v9.2 dev)

Purpose: Turn mapped buckets into understanding using function-first framing and active generation.

---
## Encode Toolkit
- Dual code: pair words + visuals; ask for sketches/annotations.
- Example → problem pairs: show a worked example, then a near-transfer problem; fade steps over time.
- Self-explain prompts: after each chunk/diagram, ask “why/how?”
- Segment & paraphrase: break into small chunks; learner restates in own words.
- Generate & check: predict/label/fill blanks, then reveal immediately.
- Quick self-checks: 1–3 recall questions after each chunk.

## Fading Guidance
- Start fully worked; shift to partial; then to independent problems/labeling.
- Fade when learner can explain steps without looking or fill blanks accurately.

## Timing
- Standard (30–60 min): ~15–20 min active encoding, with short recall breaks.
- Micro (10–15 min): one mini-cycle (read 2–3 min + sketch/label 3–4 min + 1–2 min self-explain/recall).

## Risks & Mitigations
- Overload → segment, signal key info, pre-train terms.
- Passive copying → force paraphrase/predict/label; embed self-checks.
- Misconceptions → immediate feedback; for high-precision facts, correct quickly.
- Illusion of knowing → require recall/teach-back; spaced rechecks.

## Process Corrections (v9.2)
- Word + Meaning together before imagery to trigger accurate hooks.
- Jim Kwik flow enforced: Sound → Function → Image → Lock (matches M3 dual code).
- One-step gating: do not advance without user approval on Sound, Function, Image, Resonance, Lock.
- Function-first ordering: image creation only after true action is stated.
- Resonance check: user confirms the hook “sounds right” and “feels right” before locking.

### Enforcement Checklist
1) Capture phonetic seed (sound-alike).  
2) State true function/action.  
3) Build imagery tied to that function.  
4) User resonance confirm.  
5) Lock (card/hook logged) before next step.

## Default Framework
- Use M2 (Trigger → Mechanism → Result → Implication) unless another M-series fits better; always function before structure.

## Exit Condition
- Bucket encoded with generation + feedback; learner can explain in their own words; ready for Build/Practice (M4) or next bucket.
