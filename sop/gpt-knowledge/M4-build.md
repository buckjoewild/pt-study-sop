# M4: Build (v9.2 dev)

Purpose: Practice with increasing difficulty, spacing, and variability; lock understanding and transfer.

---
## Build Toolkit
- Interleave: mix similar-but-different items once basics are known.
- Space: revisit key items multiple times within and across the session (successive relearning: 2–3 correct recalls).
- Variability: practice across varied cases/angles/contexts to improve transfer.
- Progressive ladder: guided → partial support → independent → spaced reinforcement.
- Retrieval + self-explanation: frequent recall with “why/how” reasoning.
- Feedback: immediate on factual/safety errors; brief delay OK for richer reasoning; include explanations.
- Error reflection: note each miss + correction; use for wrap/cards.

## Difficulty Ramp Template
1) Stage 1: Simple + high support (worked examples/templates/hints)
2) Stage 2: Medium + faded support (partial examples)
3) Stage 3: Full complexity, independent; simulate real conditions
4) Stage 4: Spaced reinforcement/overlearning (later quick reviews)

## Timing
- 30–60 min session: 3 × ~15 min mixed segments; 5–10 min break; space key items start/mid/end; 5–10 min wrap.
- 10–15 min micro: one narrow objective; high-intensity recall/drill; rapid feedback.

## Risks & Mitigations
- Overload/fatigue → segment, insert breaks, warm-up before hardest tasks.
- Over-randomization → controlled interleaving; maintain coherence.
- Passive practice → switch MCQ to free recall; fade hints.
- Error fossilization → timely correction + explanation.
- Confidence erosion → gradual ramp, normalize errors, small wins.

## Exit Condition
- Learner handles mixed/varied items with accuracy and reasoning; 2–3 correct spaced recalls on key items; ready for wrap.


## Faded Scaffolding (/fade)
- Step 1: Worked example (problem + full solution + thinking steps).
- Step 2: Completion problem (show problem + first steps; user finishes).
- Step 3: Independent problem (user solves fully).
Use when task complexity is high (math/coding/clinical reasoning).
