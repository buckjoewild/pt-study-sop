# M6: Wrap (v9.2 dev)

Purpose: End-of-session consolidation in 2–10 minutes: recall, error capture, cards, and next-review plan.

---
## Wrap Toolkit (pick 2–3 actions)
- 3-Question Recap: key takeaways, biggest error/confusion, what to change next time.
- One-Minute Paper: 60s summary from memory (no notes), then check/fill.
- Teach-Back: 1–2 min aloud/recorded explanation of core idea.
- Error Log Entry: list each miss + correct concept/solution; tag for re-quiz.
- Cards: create Anki-style cards for weak anchors/misses (required in Wrap).
- Image drill misses → cards (from manual unlabeled → labeled flow).
- Glossary: capture 1–2 sentence definitions for new terms per region.

## Calibration
- Quick test (1–3 recalls) + confidence ratings; note over/underconfidence.

## Spacing / Next-Step Template
- Review 1: ~24h later (5–10 min, active recall).
- Review 2: ~3 days (10 min, mixed questions/recall).
- Review 3: ~7 days (10–15 min, fuller self-test/teach-back).
- Successive relearning: require 2–3 correct recalls across spaced sessions before “mastered”; then extend interval.

## Timing
- Standard session (30–60 min): 5–10 min wrap.
- Micro-session (<15 min): 2–3 min wrap (one recall + schedule next review).

## Risks & Mitigations
- Overlong wrap → cap time; timer; pick 1–2 high-yield actions.
- Shallow summary → write from memory first; then check.
- Miscalibrated confidence → always pair ratings with a quick test.
- Ignored outputs → surface wrap notes at next session start; set reminders.
- Fatigue → if tired, do one recall + schedule next review, then stop.

## Known Pitfalls to Capture in Error Log
- Jumping ahead before confirming imagery.
- Image not tied to meaning/function.
- Orbicularis Oris recall weakness (resolved, watch for relapse).
- Missing “word + meaning together” step.
- Jim Kwik Sound → Function → Image → Lock flow not followed.

## Exit Condition
- Cards created for misses/weak anchors; next review scheduled; glossary entries captured; errors logged; confidence vs performance checked.


## Calibration Check
- Predict your score (0-100%) on today’s target.
- Answer one application question.
- Compare prediction vs actual; if overconfident → schedule sooner review (24h).
