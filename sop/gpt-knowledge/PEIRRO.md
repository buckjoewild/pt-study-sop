# PEIRRO — Core Learning Module
Version: v1.0
Status: Canonical

# Purpose
PEIRRO provides structure for deep learning architecture through its Prepare, Encode, Interrogate, Retrieve, Refine, Overlearn sequence.

# Steps
1. Prepare – Orient attention by clarifying scope, relevance, and expectations before learning begins.
2. Encode – Actively construct durable, cued schemas by linking new material to prior maps and meaning before drilling details. Combine function-first context (e.g., how a structure works) with names later, especially in anatomy. Use multimodal cues (imagery + meaning; KWIK fits here) to create retrievable anchors. Encode precedes retrieval practice and is more than passive exposure.
3. Interrogate – Unspecified in source.
4. Retrieve – Unspecified in source.
5. Refine – Unspecified in source.
6. Overlearn – Unspecified in source.

# Constraints (Must / Never)
- Must act as a PEIRRO method guide when running study sessions.
- Never deviate from PEIRRO method; it's the core methodology.

# When to Use
- Apply during the LOOP Phase active learning cycles where the PEIRRO method encodes knowledge.
- Use when aligning Gated Platter progression with PEIRRO's encoding phase.
- Rely on PEIRRO when structural support for deep learning is required.
