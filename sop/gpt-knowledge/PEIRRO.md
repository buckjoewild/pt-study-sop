# PEIRRO — Core Learning Module
Version: v1.0
Status: Canonical

# Purpose
PEIRRO provides structure for deep learning architecture through its Prepare, Encode, Interrogate, Retrieve, Refine, Overlearn sequence.

# Steps
1. Prepare – Unspecified in source.
2. Encode – PEIRRO method encodes knowledge.
3. Interrogate – Unspecified in source.
4. Retrieve – Unspecified in source.
5. Refine – Unspecified in source.
6. Overlearn – Unspecified in source.

# Constraints (Must / Never)
- Must act as a PEIRRO method guide when running study sessions.
- Never deviate from PEIRRO method; it's the core methodology.

# When to Use
- Apply during the LOOP Phase active learning cycles where the PEIRRO method encodes knowledge.
- Use when aligning Gated Platter progression with PEIRRO's encoding phase.
- Rely on PEIRRO when structural support for deep learning is required.
