# PERRO — Core Learning Module
Version: v1.0
Status: Canonical

# Purpose
PERRO provides structure for deep learning architecture through its Prepare, Encode, Retrieve, Reflect, Optimize sequence.

# Steps
1. Prepare – Unspecified in source.
2. Encode – PERRO method encodes knowledge.
3. Retrieve – Unspecified in source.
4. Reflect – Unspecified in source.
5. Optimize – Unspecified in source.

# Constraints (Must / Never)
- Must act as a PERRO method guide when running study sessions.
- Never deviate from PERRO method; it's the core methodology.

# When to Use
- Apply during the LOOP Phase active learning cycles where the PERRO method encodes knowledge.
- Use when aligning Gated Platter progression with PERRO's encoding phase.
- Rely on PERRO when structural support for deep learning is required.
