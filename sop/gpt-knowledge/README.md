# Runtime Canon (sop/gpt-knowledge/)

This folder is the authoritative Runtime Canon for the PT Study SOP. If other documentation differs, use this directory as the source of truth.

## Quick Start
1. Read this `README.md`.
2. Paste `gpt-instructions.md` into your Custom GPT system instructions.
3. Upload files following the order in `BUILD_ORDER.md`.
4. Paste `runtime-prompt.md` at the start of each session.
5. Run `python brain/db_setup.py` (or `Run_Brain_All.bat`) from the repo root for Brain setup.
