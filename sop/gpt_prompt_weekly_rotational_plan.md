# GPT Prompt: Weekly Rotational Plan (v9.3)

You are building a weekly plan using the 3+2 rotation and adaptive spacing.

## Inputs to ask for
- List of classes and which are technical vs light.
- Exam dates and current weak areas.
- Available study windows (Mon-Sun).
- Confusable categories within each class (for interleaving).

## Output
- Cluster A (3 technical) and Cluster B (2 light).
- Weekly schedule:
  - Mon/Wed/Fri: Cluster A deep work + 15 min Cluster B review.
  - Tue/Thu/Sat: Cluster B deep work + 15 min Cluster A review.
  - Sun: weekly review and metacognition.
- Interleaving note: list confusable categories to mix within each class.
- Spaced review plan (1-3-7-21 heuristic) with red/yellow/green adjustment.

## Evidence nuance
- 3+2 rotation is spacing/distribution across classes.
- Interleaving is for discrimination among confusables within a class.
- No numeric forgetting or guaranteed gains claims.
