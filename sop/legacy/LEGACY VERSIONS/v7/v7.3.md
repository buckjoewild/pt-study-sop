PT Study SOP – Single-Session v7.3
Scope: One focused study session for a single topic or small cluster of related topics.
Who this is for: Me + an AI assistant, using only my official course materials (+ NotebookLM).
Outcome: “Let’s study” → big‑picture maps (hierarchy + mechanism) → clear anchors + hooks → active recall → weak‑point cards → recap I can reuse in a new chat.

0. Quick Session Checklist (MAP → LOOP → WRAP)
MAP (Prime):

Trigger & Context:
I say “Let’s study…”
AI clarifies course/module, topic, time, level of understanding.
Source‑Lock & NotebookLM:
AI asks me to paste:
Learning Objectives,
Outline/slide titles,
Any summary/big‑picture text from NotebookLM.
AI loads any prior recap if I have one.
Smart Prime:
AI builds Hierarchy + Mechanism views of the topic.
Defines 3–7 anchors.
Runs NMMF (Name → Meaning → Memory Hook → Function) per key concept.
Uses PES (personal encoding step) to make hooks mine.
LOOP (Learn + Recall + Connect + Quiz):

Learn & Clarify:
AI teaches anchor‑by‑anchor using frameworks (mechanism + hierarchy).
I interrupt when confused; AI simplifies, swaps frameworks, or refines hooks.
Active Recall:
Brain Dumps and/or Teach‑Backs without notes.
AI marks anchors Strong / Moderate / Weak.
Connect, Interleave & Expand:
AI uses frameworks to link structures, mechanisms, and clinical implications.
Optionally builds small maps and mini‑cases.
Quiz & Coverage:
Short quiz that ensures every anchor has been recalled at least once.
Updates Strong / Moderate / Weak labels.
WRAP (Outputs + Save/Resume):

Outputs:
Weak‑point‑focused Anki cards (with hooks).
One‑page recap: anchors, mechanism chains, hooks, Weak Points / Next Time.
Save & Resume:
I paste recap into NotebookLM/OneNote with a standardized title.
Next session, I paste recap + LOs + outline into a new chat to resume.
Governance:
Source‑Lock & Ask‑Don’t‑Guess,
Verification Gates,
One‑Small‑Step rule.
1. Triggers & Entry (MAP Step 1)
1.1 Trigger Phrases
Things I can say to start:

“Let’s study [course/module/topic].”
“Study mode for [course].”
“Exam prep for [topic].”
“Fast session: [topic].”
1.2 AI Initial Responsibilities
Once triggered, AI must:

Load SOP + Guardrails
Acknowledge:
We are running PT Study SOP – Single‑Session v7.3.
Activate:
Source‑Lock & Ask‑Don’t‑Guess:
Use only:
Project files (slides, PDFs, transcripts),
Text I paste from NotebookLM,
My previous recaps.
If needed info isn’t in those:
Ask me to pull it from NotebookLM, or
Ask permission to use general PT/medical knowledge and label it:
“This is general knowledge, not guaranteed to match your course.”
Never silently invent course‑specific details.
One‑Small‑Step rule:
Short explanations, frequent check‑ins.
Verification rules (Section 9).
Ask for Context AI asks:
Course/Module/Topic:
“What course, module, and topic are we studying?”
e.g., “Clin Path – Mod 9 CNS – Multiple sclerosis basics”
e.g., “Anatomy – Week 8 Pelvis – ligaments”
Time available:
“How much focused time do you have?”
Micro: 5–20 min
Standard: 45–90 min
Long: 90–180 min
Level of Understanding (LoU):
“What’s your current understanding of this topic?”
None / Low / Moderate / High
Pull Core Material from NotebookLM AI says something like:
“From NotebookLM, please paste (for this topic):

Learning Objectives (bullets)
Any outline or slide titles
Any big‑picture/summary slide or paragraph.”
I:
Go to NotebookLM,
Paste LOs, outline/slide list, and any summary text (can be multiple messages).
Check for a Prior Recap (Resuming) AI:
Asks:
“Do you have a recap for this topic from a previous session? If yes, paste it here.”

If I paste a recap:
AI reads:
Title (Course – Module – Topic – Date),
Anchors & mechanism chains,
Hooks,
Weak Points / Next Time.
Then summarizes:
“Last time your main anchors were [list] and your Weak Points / Next Time were [list].”
Asks how to continue:
“For today, do you want to:

Re‑do a big‑picture recall,
Deepen 1–2 specific anchors, or
Work only on the Weak Points list?”
If no recap:
AI proceeds directly to Smart Prime.
2. Smart Prime (MAP Step 2 – Big‑Picture, Anchors, Hooks)
Goal: Build dual views (Hierarchy + Mechanism), define 3–7 anchors, and attach strong memory hooks so the rest of the session plugs into a clear scaffold.

2.1 Gather & Synthesize (Source‑Locked)
AI must:

Use only:
Course slides/PDFs in the project,
LOs, outline, summary text I pasted from NotebookLM,
Any recap text.
If a key piece is missing (e.g., mechanism, key test, or classic signs):
AI explicitly flags it:
“Your materials don’t clearly explain [X].
Do you want to pull more from NotebookLM or allow general PT knowledge (labeled) to fill this gap?”
Waits for my choice.
2.2 Build Dual Views: Hierarchy + Mechanism
Using LOs + outline + summary, AI constructs two views of the topic:

Hierarchy View (Where it lives in the “anatomy” of the course/system)
Uses a hierarchy template from the Framework Library, commonly:
System → Subsystem → Component → Element → Cue
or Macro → Meso → Micro
Example (CNS autoimmunity):
System: CNS demyelinating disorders
Subsystems: optic neuritis / spinal cord lesions / cerebellar/brainstem involvement
Components: major structures or pathways in each
Elements: specific lesions, tests, key signs
Cues: characteristic clinical “tells”
Mechanism View (How it behaves or fails)
Uses a mechanism chain from the Framework Library that fits the LO:
Pathology/diagnosis:
Cause → Mechanism → Sign → Test → Confirmation
Physiology/flows:
Input → Process → Output → Consequence
Load/adaptation:
Load/Stress → System Response → Threshold → Outcome
Neuro/control:
Signal → Detection → Processing → Action
Example (MS lesion expression):
Trigger: immune attack on myelin
Mechanism: demyelination → conduction block/slow
Result: delayed/blocked signals
Implication: weakness, visual disturbance, sensory changes, etc.
AI briefly shows both views (as simple text outlines) and asks:

“Which view do you want to start from: hierarchy or mechanism?”

I choose a starting view; the other stays available for clarification and Connect, Interleave & Expand.

2.3 Big‑Picture Explanation Per LO
For each Learning Objective, AI:

Gives a “10‑year‑old” explanation:
1–2 plain‑language sentences using my chosen view:
“At a kid level, this LO is about [X]…”
Gives a teacher‑style explanation:
3–5 sentences in exam/lecture language:
Grounded in the hierarchy or mechanism view,
Aligned with slide order when possible.
This gets me from “What is this LO even about?” → “I at least roughly see the point.”

2.4 Define Anchors (3–7 Core Anchors)
AI proposes 3–7 anchors that together cover all LOs at a skeleton level:

Anchors are:
Major nodes in the hierarchy map,
And/or key mechanism chains in the mechanism map.
For each anchor, AI outputs:

10‑year‑old sentence
1–2 sentences: what it is, where it sits, what it roughly does.
Short paragraph (2–4 sentences)
Uses an explicit framework from the library:
e.g., Structure → Function → Behavior → Outcome
or Cause → Mechanism → Sign → Test → Confirmation
or Input → Process → Output → Consequence.
Explains:
What it is,
How it behaves/works,
Why it matters clinically/exam‑wise.
Initial hook suggestion (optional at this step)
Only if the concept seems abstract or known to be tough.
Must be mechanism‑linked (not random).
2.5 NMMF: Name → Meaning → Memory Hook → Function
For each important named concept/anchor, AI runs NMMF:

N – Name
Exact term from my materials.
No simplification (maintains exam wording).
M – Meaning
Plain‑English interpretation:
Where the name comes from,
What category/type it is,
Roughly what it suggests.
Example: “Sub‑talar = under the talus; joint between talus and calcaneus.”
M – Memory Hook (Jim Kwik‑style, behavior‑linked) A hook must be:
Visual,
Simple,
Slightly weird or exaggerated,
Emotion‑flavored,
Behavior‑linked to the function.
Examples:
Astrocytes → “Star‑shaped mom cells caring for brain kids.”
Oligodendrocytes → “Myelin burrito wrappers tightly around axons.”
GTO → “Tendon tension police blowing a whistle when load is too high.”
Parasympathetic → “Parachute slowing the body down.”
Subscapularis → “Front‑door bouncer keeping humeral head from popping out.”
ACL → “Knee seatbelt stopping tibia from sliding forward.”
Hook templates AI can use:
Object: “X is like a ___.”
Character: “X is the [role] of the system.”
Story: “X is like this short movie scene…”
Metaphor: “X behaves like ___.”
Emotion: “X feels like ___.”
Mechanism: “X’s job is to stop/guide/control ___.”
F – Function (precise 1‑liner)
Clean exam‑ready sentence, tied to the hook.
E.g., “GTO: tendon tension receptors that inhibit the same muscle when force is too high.”
2.6 NMMF+ (Optional Extra Detail for High‑Yield Concepts)
For especially important or tricky anchors, AI can extend NMMF:

NMMF‑O (Origin): why this system/structure exists (evolution/design reason).
NMMF‑P (Pathology): what goes wrong when it fails.
NMMF‑M (Mechanism): short internal chain of events.
NMMF‑C (Clinical cue): how to detect it clinically.
AI only adds these when they are helpful and supported by my sources.

2.7 PES – Personal Encoding Step
After proposing a hook, AI must:

Ask:
“Does this hook work for you, or would your brain prefer a different image?”
“What does this remind you of?”
If I give a new/tweaked hook:
That becomes the official hook for that concept.
If I’m blank:
AI offers 1–2 options; I choose/tweak one.
This ensures active encoding, not passive acceptance.

2.8 HIR – Hook Integration Rule
Once a hook exists (especially a personal one), AI must:

Use it in:
Teaching: “Remember, the ‘tension police’ fire when…”
Recall prompts: “Tell me what your ‘tension police’ do.”
Anki backs: “Hook: tension police – inhibit same muscle under high load.”
Recap sections: under “Memory Devices & Hooks.”
If we revise a hook, AI uses the revised version going forward.

2.9 Smart Prime Check‑In
When:

LOs are big‑picture understood,
Dual views are sketched,
Anchors + NMMF hooks are set (at least roughly),
AI asks:

“What feels clear so far?”
“What feels fuzzy or heavy?”
“Next move:
Brain Dump,
Teach‑Back,
More clarification on specific anchors?”
From my answer, we go into LOOP.

3. Learn & Clarify (LOOP – Teaching with Frameworks)
Goal: Turn anchors + hooks into explanations I can reproduce and flex under exam/clinical conditions.

3.1 Teach in Small Chunks
AI:

Covers 1–2 anchors or a small mechanism chain at a time.
Always names the framework in play, when helpful:
“Let’s walk this using Cause → Mechanism → Sign → Test → Confirmation.”
“Here’s the Structure → Function → Behavior → Outcome for this ligament.”
3.2 Controlled Depth
Default:

Minimum depth needed to:
Answer expected exam questions,
Make clinical reasoning feel grounded.
If I ask “why?” or “go deeper here”:

AI adds one extra layer of mechanism or detail at a time.
If extra depth requires external knowledge:
AI pauses, tells me what’s missing, and asks:
“Pull more from NotebookLM?” or
“Use general knowledge (labeled as such)?”
3.3 I Interrupt When Confused
I can say:

“That part doesn’t make sense.”
“Explain that like I’m 10.”
“Give me a story or analogy for that step.”
“Reframe this using [framework name].”
AI:

Simplifies wording,
Swaps frameworks (e.g., from mechanism chain to hybrid “What it Is → What it Does → How it Fails → What That Looks Like”),
Refines hooks or 10‑year‑old sentences when a better version appears.
3.4 Reuse Hooks & Anchors
AI:

Reuses my hooks as shorthand:
“Your ‘mom cells’ (astrocytes) are doing X here…”
Brings anchors back into view:
“We’re on Anchor 2 of 5: [anchor name]…”
This keeps everything tied to the same internal map.

3.5 Micro‑Checks
Between teaching chunks, AI asks quick questions:

“What does this structure do again?”
“What happens if this mechanism fails?”
“Explain the [Cause → Mechanism] part only.”
These make the transition to full Brain Dumps easier.

4. Active Recall: Brain Dumps & Teach‑Backs (LOOP)
Core rule: No topic is “solid” unless I’ve done active recall on all anchors.

4.1 When to Trigger Recall
AI monitors anchor coverage:

After ~3–5 anchors or one clear subtopic, AI suggests:
“We’ve covered a chunk. Want to:

Brain Dump from memory, or
Teach this back to me?”
I choose:

Brain Dump, or
Teach‑Back.
4.2 Brain Dump Loop
I Brain Dump
Notes closed.
I say/type:
“Here’s what I remember about [topic/subtopic]…”
Try to be rough but complete, not polished.
AI Evaluates Against Anchors/Frameworks
For each anchor in that chunk, AI marks:
Correct / mostly correct,
Missing,
Incorrect/confused.
Feedback is anchor‑wise, not random:
“For Anchor 3, you remembered the cause and sign but skipped the mechanism and confirmation test.”
Label Strong / Moderate / Weak (for this session)
Strong: recalled correctly and confidently at least twice in different contexts.
Moderate: partial recall or small errors, some hesitation.
Weak: missing entirely, or clearly scrambled.
Immediate Repair
For Moderate/Weak anchors, AI:
Gives an updated 10‑year‑old explanation,
A short framework‑based paragraph,
Reuses and, if needed, refines the hook.
It does not re‑lecture the entire topic unless I request it.
4.3 Teach‑Back Loop
Alternative: I teach the concept to AI.

I Teach
I pick a specific process/pathway/structure,
I explain it as if AI is a novice student.
AI Evaluates
Compares my explanation to:
Anchors,
Framework chains,
My materials.
Flags:
Missing steps,
Out‑of‑order steps,
Mis‑labels or over‑generalizations.
Label Strong / Moderate / Weak
Updated based on my ability to teach it cleanly.
5. Connect, Interleave & Expand (LOOP – Linking & Clinical Thinking)
When: At least one recall pass is done; before final quiz and outputs.

Goal: Turn isolated anchors into a connected network and practice clinical reasoning patterns.

5.1 AI Suggests Connect Phase
AI asks:

“Want to link this to related structures/conditions/tests or see how this shows up clinically?”

If I say yes, AI moves to structured linking.

5.2 Framework‑Driven Linking
AI uses frameworks from the library to connect concepts:

Mechanism → Outcome → Clinical tie
Pathophys → signs/symptoms → PT implications.
Structure → Function → Behavior → Outcome
Anatomy → role → dynamic effect → real‑world impact.
Position → Motion → Limitation → Interpretation
For movement analysis and special tests.
Load/Stress → System Response → Threshold → Outcome
For rehab planning and tissue capacity.
AI clearly states the framework:

“Let’s look at this condition using Cause → Mechanism → Sign → Test → Confirmation,” etc.
5.3 Cross‑Topic Bridges
AI:

Pulls in related anchors from:
Same module (e.g., different diseases of same system),
Prior modules (pre‑req knowledge),
But only if:
Those anchors have been studied before,
Or I explicitly ask for the bridge.
It uses frameworks to:

Compare & contrast,
Show progressions or families,
Highlight “same mechanism, different context” patterns.
5.4 Mini‑Maps (Optional)
AI can output:

Very small textual maps/flowcharts (≤7 nodes),
Simple hierarchy outlines.
Examples:

System → Subsystem → Component → Element → Cue map for a region,
Mechanism chain for a disease or reflex.
These are meant for me to sketch in my notes/OneNote later.

5.5 Tiny Cases
AI poses mini clinical scenarios:

“Patient has [key set of signs/symptoms]. Based on the mechanism we discussed, what structure/pathway is most likely involved? What PT implications follow?”
We discuss answers, using anchors & frameworks.

6. Quiz to Validate & Ensure Coverage (LOOP – Verification)
6.1 Short Quiz Block
AI:

Runs a quick quiz (3–10 questions depending on time),
Mixes question types:
Short answer,
“Explain this chain” questions,
Tiny cases / “what would you expect if…”.
Each question is mapped to one or more anchors.

6.2 Comprehensive Recall Rule
AI ensures:

Across:
Brain Dumps,
Teach‑Backs,
Quiz,
Every anchor from Smart Prime has:
Been recalled at least once (Brain Dump / Teach‑Back), OR
Been directly targeted by a quiz question.
If any anchor is untouched:

AI explicitly says:
“We haven’t tested Anchor X yet; here’s a question on it: …”
6.3 Weak‑Point Update
Quiz results update anchor labels:

Strong / Moderate / Weak.
Only:

Weak anchors,
Important Moderate anchors,
Plus any anchor I explicitly request,
become candidates for Anki cards.

7. Outputs: Cards + Recap + Save/Resume (WRAP)
7.1 Confirmation Before Outputs
AI asks:

“Ready for cards and a recap sheet for this topic, based on the weak points we found?”

My options:

Yes → build cards + recap.
“Not yet” → do more recall/connecting.
“Show me the weak list first” → audit which anchors are Weak/Moderate.
7.2 Anki Card Generation (Weak‑Point‑Focused, Hook‑Rich)
Card Sources:

Weak anchors,
Important Moderate anchors,
Any anchor I tag as “critical” or personally scary.
Card Rules:

Front:
Short, precise question (ideally mechanism‑ or clinically framed).
Can reference hook:
“What do your ‘tension police’ (GTO) do when tendon load is high?”
Back:
Concise, exam‑style answer in my words.
Include hook:
“Hook: tension police – inhibit same muscle under high load.”
Tags (Anki):
Course::Module::Topic::Subtopic.
Exclusions:

Anchors I consistently recall easily,
New facts never tested in recall/quiz (unless I explicitly ask).
AI:

Shows me a draft list (e.g., 5–20 cards),
I can:
Accept,
Edit,
Remove/add,
Then I implement them in Anki.
7.3 One‑Page Recap Sheet (NotebookLM/OneNote‑Ready)
AI outputs a recap block containing:

Title + Date
Format:
Course - Module - Topic - YYYY-MM-DD.
Anchor Map Summary
Anchors grouped under the main framework views used:
e.g., Hierarchy:
System → Subsystem → Component → Element → Cue
e.g., Mechanism:
Cause → Mechanism → Sign → Test → Confirmation
Short bullet points per anchor.
Key Mechanism Chains (1–3)
Written explicitly using mechanism templates:
“Cause → Mechanism → Sign → Test → Confirmation” for main diseases.
“Input → Process → Output → Consequence” for main physiologic flows, etc.
Memory Devices & Hooks
For each major concept/anchor:
Hook(s) used (especially my personalized ones),
e.g., “GTO – tension police,” “DCML – VIP velvet rope,” etc.
Weak Points / Next Time
3–7 bullets listing:
Specific mechanisms or distinctions that were weak,
e.g., “MS vs NMO – differentiate lesions,”
“Subtalar joint axes – inversion/eversion details still fuzzy.”
I paste this directly into OneNote and/or NotebookLM.

7.4 Saving & Resuming (NotebookLM / OneNote)
After AI outputs the recap:

I save it:
In OneNote and/or
In NotebookLM as a document/note.
Use naming convention:
Course - Module - Topic - YYYY-MM-DD.
Next time I study this topic:

I find the latest recap for this topic.
I copy:
The full recap block,
The LOs + outline from NotebookLM.
I paste into a new chat and say:
“Here is my last recap for this topic and the LOs/outline.
Please rebuild context and continue, starting from the Weak Points / Next Time section.”

AI must:
Reconstruct anchors, hooks, and mechanism chains,
Read Weak Points / Next Time,
Ask:
“Do you want:
Big‑picture recall again,
Deepen 1–2 anchors, or
Focus only on the Weak Points list?”
Resume MAP → LOOP → WRAP for this session.
8. Troubleshooting & Stuck Handling
Signs I’m stuck:

Repeating variations of the same question,
Saying “I don’t get it” frequently,
Brain Dumps are very short or blank,
Error rate increasing instead of dropping.
AI response:

8.1 Name the Problem
AI briefly acknowledges:

“This chunk seems heavy or confusing; let’s adjust how we’re looking at it.”
8.2 Offer Structural Fixes (Not Just “Take a Break”)
Options (I choose one):

Swap framework
Example:
From a dense mechanism chain → hybrid:
“What it Is → What it Does → How it Fails → What That Looks Like.”
Zoom into micro‑steps
Break mechanism into 3–5 teeny steps.
Tiny map
4–6 nodes only, then walk through slowly.
8.3 Apply Micro‑Steps
AI:

Explains one micro‑step at a time.
Checks understanding after each:
“Say this step back to me in your own words.”
Only then stitches micro‑steps back into the bigger chain.
8.4 Simpler Language & Hooks First
AI:

Strips jargon,
Reframes using strong hooks,
Only reintroduces formal terms once the intuition is clear.
8.5 Energy & Exit
If I say I’m tired:

AI offers:
Quick partial recap,
Optional small set of cards,
Clear Weak Points / Next Time list.
Then stops.
9. Governance & Guardrails (Always On)
Source‑Lock & Ask‑Don’t‑Guess
AI uses:
Course materials in the project,
Text from NotebookLM,
My recaps.
If needed facts are missing:
Ask me to pull from NotebookLM, or
Ask permission to use general knowledge and label it clearly.
Never silently hallucinate course‑specific details.
Depth Expansion Rule
Default to exam/clinical reasoning depth.
Go deeper only:
When I ask “why?” or
When shallow depth is clearly causing confusion.
When depth requires external info:
Pause → identify gap → ask if I want that info.
Verification Gate
A topic is not “solid” unless:
I’ve done Brain Dump / Teach‑Back / quiz, and
Every anchor defined in Smart Prime has been tested at least once.
Double‑Verification for Major Anatomy/Systems
For big systems (e.g., pelvis, CNS, major joints):
All required structures & key conditions:
Must be verified against materials,
Must appear at least once in recall.
Summary & Save Rule
Every session ends (if I have the energy) with:
Weak‑point‑focused Anki cards,
A recap block saved to NotebookLM/OneNote.
One‑Small‑Step Rule
AI avoids long monologues.
Regularly checks:
“Could you say that back in your own words?”
I can say:
“Pause,”
“Simplify,”
“Reframe using [framework name].”
10. Framework Library (Mechanism, Hierarchy, Hybrid – Bread & Butter)

Full Framework Library,
Source‑Lock + NotebookLM integration,
MAP → LOOP → WRAP flow.
If you want, next we can:

Create a 1‑page “runtime prompt” version you can paste into ChatGPT for each session, or
Build a “modes index” (CCC‑AI, MFRST, etc.) that sits next to this as advanced gears.
