# PT Study SOP v8.1.1 — Module 5: Troubleshooting

**Purpose:** Reference guide for handling stuck points, confusion, and edge cases.  
**When to consult:** When user shows signs of being stuck or session isn't flowing.

---

## STUCK DETECTION

### Signs the User is Stuck

| Signal | What It Looks Like |
|--------|-------------------|
| **Repetition** | Asking similar questions multiple times, circling back to same concept |
| **Blank recall** | Brain Dump produces very little or nothing; long pauses |
| **Confusion cascade** | "I don't get it" followed by more confusion after explanation |
| **Error escalation** | Making more mistakes as session continues, not fewer |
| **Disengagement** | Short responses, "I guess," "sure," less energy |
| **Framework mismatch** | Concept doesn't fit the current framework's structure |

### Signs of Fatigue vs. Confusion

| Fatigue | Confusion |
|---------|-----------|
| Knew it earlier, can't recall now | Never demonstrated understanding |
| Slower responses, less detail | Responses show misunderstanding |
| "I'm tired" / "I need a break" | "This doesn't make sense" |
| General decline across topics | Specific concept is the problem |

**Fatigue response:** Offer graceful exit (see ENERGY & EXIT below)  
**Confusion response:** Apply stuck fixes

## STUCK FIXES (In Order of Escalation)

### Fix 1: Drop Explanation Level

**When:** User understood simpler version but lost it at higher level

**Action:**
1. Identify current explanation level (1-4)
2. Drop one level
3. Rebuild understanding at lower level
4. Only re-escalate when user demonstrates mastery

**Script:**
> "Let me back up. [Restate at simpler level]. Does that land better?"

---

### Fix 2: Swap Framework

**When:** Current framework isn't fitting the content or user's thinking style

**Action:**
1. Acknowledge the mismatch: "This framework might not be the right lens here."
2. Propose alternative from same topic-type (see Module 3)
3. Re-present the stuck concept using new framework
4. Check if new framework clicks

**Script:**
> "Let's try looking at this differently. Instead of [current framework], what if we use [alternative]? That would organize it as..."

---

### Fix 3: Micro-Step Breakdown

**When:** Concept has too many parts happening at once

**Action:**
1. Identify the mechanism or process that's confusing
2. Break it into 3-5 tiny sequential steps
3. Teach each micro-step separately with check-in
4. Only after all steps are solid, reconnect them

**Script:**
> "This has a lot of parts. Let's slow way down and take it piece by piece.
> Step 1: [single thing]. Clear?
> Step 2: [single thing]. Clear?
> ...
> Now let's connect them: Step 1 leads to Step 2 because..."

---

### Fix 4: Hook-First Teaching

**When:** Abstract concept isn't sticking despite explanation

**Action:**
1. Skip the formal explanation temporarily
2. Lead with a vivid hook/analogy/story
3. Let the hook create intuition
4. Then attach formal terms to the hook

**Script:**
> "Forget the technical stuff for a second. Think of it like this: [hook/analogy].
> ...
> Does that image make sense? Good. Now, the formal term for that is..."

---

### Fix 5: Concrete-to-Abstract

**When:** User is lost in theory, needs grounding

**Action:**
1. Start with a specific, concrete example or case
2. Walk through what happens in that example
3. Extract the general principle from the example
4. Test with a second example to confirm transfer

**Script:**
> "Let's start with a specific situation: [example].
> In this case, what happens is...
> The general principle here is...
> Let's test: if [different example], what would you expect?"

---

### Fix 6: User Teaches Back Partially

**When:** User thinks they understand but can't produce

**Action:**
1. Ask user to explain just the part they think they know
2. Listen for gaps or errors
3. Fill specific gaps rather than re-teaching everything
4. Have them re-teach with gap filled

**Script:**
> "Tell me what you DO understand about this, even if it's partial.
> ...
> Okay, you've got [X] and [Y]. The piece you're missing is [Z]. Here's how Z works...
> Now put it all together for me."

---

## SPECIFIC PROBLEM PATTERNS

### Pattern: "I knew this yesterday"

**Cause:** Normal forgetting, insufficient encoding, or retrieval failure

**Fix:**
1. Don't re-teach from scratch
2. Provide retrieval cue: "Remember we used the hook [X]? What did that connect to?"
3. If cue works → practice retrieval a few more times
4. If cue doesn't work → brief re-teach of the specific forgotten piece

---

### Pattern: Mixing Up Similar Concepts

**Cause:** Insufficient distinction, competing memories

**Fix:**
1. Put both concepts side by side explicitly
2. Identify the key distinguishing feature
3. Create a contrastive hook: "A is [X], B is [Y] — think of it as [distinction image]"
4. Quiz specifically on the distinction, not just each concept alone

**Script:**
> "You're mixing up [A] and [B]. Let's put them side by side.
> A: [definition]. B: [definition].
> The key difference: [distinction].
> A good way to remember: [contrastive hook].
> Quick check: [question that requires distinguishing them]"

---

### Pattern: Can Recall Facts, Can't Apply

**Cause:** Knowledge is isolated, not connected to use cases

**Fix:**
1. Present a simple scenario requiring the knowledge
2. Walk through the reasoning together
3. Present a second scenario, have user try
4. Add scenarios to weak points list

**Script:**
> "You know the facts. Let's practice using them.
> Scenario: [situation]. Given what you know about [concept], what would you expect/do?
> ...
> Good. Here's another one: [scenario]. Your turn."

---

### Pattern: Overwhelmed by Volume

**Cause:** Too many anchors or too much content at once

**Fix:**
1. Pause and acknowledge the volume
2. Identify the 2-3 MOST important items for this session
3. Explicitly set aside the rest for later
4. Focus only on the priority items

**Script:**
> "There's a lot here. Let's not try to master everything right now.
> For today, the most important things are: [list 2-3].
> We'll come back to the rest. For now, let's nail these."

## ENERGY & EXIT

### Recognizing Low Energy

- Shorter responses
- More "I don't know" or "I guess"
- Declining performance on concepts that were previously solid
- User says they're tired/done

### Graceful Exit Protocol

1. **Acknowledge:** "It sounds like you're hitting a wall. Totally normal."

2. **Offer options:**
   - "Want to push through [X] more minutes and then stop?"
   - "Want to stop now and save what we've done?"
   - "Want to do one more quick recall and then wrap?"

3. **Generate partial outputs:**
   - Abbreviated recap with current status
   - Minimal card set (only most critical weak points)
   - Clear "Next Time" list

4. **End cleanly:**
   - "Good session. Save this recap. When you're ready, 'Resume [topic]' and we'll pick up."

---

## EDGE CASES

### User Has Materials But They're Incomplete

**Situation:** LOs or outline don't contain enough detail to teach from

**Action:**
1. Note what's missing: "Your materials don't explain [X] in detail."
2. Offer choices:
   - "Pull more from NotebookLM on [specific thing]?"
   - "Use general PT knowledge for this piece? (I'll label it)"
3. Wait for user decision before proceeding

---

### User Disagrees With Course Material

**Situation:** User says "My professor said it differently" or "That's not what my slides say"

**Action:**
1. Defer to their course materials — that's what they're tested on
2. Ask: "Can you paste what your slides say?"
3. Teach from their version, even if it differs from general knowledge
4. If conflict seems like an error, note: "You might want to clarify with your professor"

---

### Session Gets Interrupted

**Situation:** User has to leave suddenly, session ends abruptly

**Action:**
1. If possible, generate quick recap even if incomplete
2. Mark exact stopping point: "In Progress: [specific LO/anchor]"
3. List what was not covered in "Weak Points / Next Time"
4. If no time for recap: Note that next session should start with quick orientation

---

### New Information Contradicts Prior Recap

**Situation:** User pastes recap, but new materials show different information

**Action:**
1. Note the discrepancy: "Your recap says [X], but these new materials say [Y]."
2. Ask: "Should we update based on the new materials, or check with your professor first?"
3. Treat as "same topic, updated version" — rebuild relevant anchors
4. Keep old hooks if they still work; update if mechanism changed
