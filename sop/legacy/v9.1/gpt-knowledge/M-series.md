# M-Series — Encoding/Logic Frameworks

## Purpose
Convert information into understanding by framing with function-first logic. Used in M3 (Encode) and M4 (Build) phases.

---

## M2: Trigger (Default Encoding Tool)

### Pattern
```
Trigger → Mechanism → Result → Implication
```

### When to Use
- Processes and cause-effect relationships
- Anything with a sequence of events
- Most encoding situations (default)

### Example: ACL Tear
```
Trigger: Pivot/twist with foot planted + valgus force
Mechanism: ACL fibers exceed tensile strength → rupture
Result: Anterior tibial translation, rotational instability
Implication: Surgery often needed; high re-injury risk without proper rehab
```

### Instruction
"Let's frame this with M2 — what TRIGGERS this? What's the mechanism?"

---

## M6: Homeostasis

### Pattern
```
Perturbation → Stability → Correction → Baseline
```

### When to Use
- Regulatory systems
- Feedback loops
- Anything that maintains balance

### Example: Blood Pressure Regulation
```
Perturbation: BP drops (hemorrhage, standing quickly)
Stability: Baroreceptors detect drop
Correction: SNS activation → vasoconstriction, increased HR
Baseline: BP returns toward normal
```

### Instruction
"What disturbs the system? How does it correct?"

---

## M8: Diagnosis

### Pattern
```
Cause → Mechanism → Sign → Test → Confirmation
```

### When to Use
- Pathology
- Clinical reasoning
- Differential diagnosis

### Example: Rotator Cuff Tear
```
Cause: Overuse, trauma, degeneration
Mechanism: Tendon fibers fail → partial or full thickness tear
Sign: Pain with overhead activity, weakness in abduction/rotation, night pain
Test: Empty can test, drop arm test, imaging
Confirmation: MRI shows tendon discontinuity
```

### Instruction
"Walk through the clinical reasoning — cause to confirmation."

---

## Y1: Generalist (Quick Overview)

### Pattern
```
What is it → What does it do → How does it fail → What that looks like
```

### When to Use
- Quick orientation to unfamiliar topic
- Don't know which specific framework fits
- Broad overview before deep dive

### Example: Meniscus
```
What is it: C-shaped fibrocartilage pads in the knee (medial and lateral)
What does it do: Shock absorption, load distribution, stability, lubrication
How does it fail: Tear (degenerative or traumatic), typically medial meniscus
What that looks like: Knee pain, catching/locking, swelling, McMurray's positive
```

### Instruction
"Quick Y1 scan — what is it, what does it do, how does it fail?"

## Choosing a Framework

| Situation | Use | Why |
|-----------|-----|-----|
| Process/sequence | M2 (Trigger) | Shows cause-effect chain |
| Regulation/balance | M6 (Homeostasis) | Shows feedback loop |
| Pathology/clinical | M8 (Diagnosis) | Clinical reasoning path |
| Unknown/overview | Y1 (Generalist) | Quick orientation |

**Default:** Start with M2 unless another clearly fits better.

---

## Function → Structure Override

Regardless of framework, always state FUNCTION before STRUCTURE.

**Wrong:** "The ACL attaches from the posterior femur to the anterior tibia."  
**Right:** "The ACL prevents anterior tibial translation. It runs from posterior femur to anterior tibia."

The job comes first. The anatomy supports the job.

## Quick Reference

| Framework | Pattern | Best For |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| M2 (Trigger) | Trigger → Mechanism → Result → Implication | Processes, cause-effect |
| M6 (Homeostasis) | Perturbation → Correction → Baseline | Regulation, feedback |
| M8 (Diagnosis) | Cause → Mechanism → Sign → Test → Confirmation | Pathology, clinical |
| Y1 (Generalist) | What → Does → Fails → Looks like | Quick overview |

## RAG / Verification
- Cite user-provided snippets first; if none, mark outputs as unverified and keep claims cautious.
- Default verbosity: 2 short paragraphs or up to 6 bullets unless user requests more detail.
