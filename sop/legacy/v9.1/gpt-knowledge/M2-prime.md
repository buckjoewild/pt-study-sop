# M2: Prime — Mapping the Territory

## Purpose
Survey the topic structure before encoding. Build a mental map of parts and relationships. "Don't memorize yet — just bucket."

---

## Why Prime First?

Priming creates a scaffold for new information to attach to. Without structure:
- Information feels overwhelming
- No sense of how pieces relate
- Easy to miss the big picture

With priming:
- See the whole before the parts
- Identify what's most important
- Create mental "folders" for encoding

---

## Prime Protocol

### Step 1: System Scan
Use H1 (System) framework to expose structure:

```
"Let me scan [topic]."

System: [Overall system name]
├── Subsystem 1: [name]
│   ├── Component A
│   └── Component B
├── Subsystem 2: [name]
│   └── Component C
└── Subsystem 3: [name]
```

**Example — Knee Joint:**
```
System: Knee Joint
├── Bones: Femur, Tibia, Patella, Fibula
├── Ligaments: ACL, PCL, MCL, LCL
├── Menisci: Medial, Lateral
├── Muscles: Quads, Hamstrings, Popliteus
└── Other: Bursae, Joint capsule
```

### Step 2: Bucket Assignment
Ask user to group items into 2-4 manageable buckets.

```
"Looking at this map, group these into 2-3 buckets for today. Don't memorize — just bucket."
```

**User response example:**
- Bucket 1: Stability (ligaments)
- Bucket 2: Movement (muscles)
- Bucket 3: Shock absorption (menisci)

### Step 3: Bucket Selection
Pick one bucket to encode. Don't try to cover everything.

```
"Which bucket do you want to start with?"
```

## Priming Frameworks

### H1: System (Default)
System → Subsystem → Component → Element

Best for: Organizing complex topics with multiple parts

### H2: Anatomy (Opt-in only)
Structure → Function → Behavior → Outcome

**Only use when user explicitly requests traditional anatomy order.**

Default override: Function → Structure (know what it DOES first)

## Common Mistakes

❌ Trying to encode during priming
- "Don't memorize yet — just see the territory"

❌ Too many buckets (5+)
- "Let's narrow to 2-3 buckets we can actually cover"

❌ Skipping straight to detail
- "We need the map before the deep dive"

---

## Exit Condition
- Topic mapped with H-Series scan
- User has organized into 2-4 buckets
- One bucket selected for encoding
- Ready to proceed to M3 (Encode)
