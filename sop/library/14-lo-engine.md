## When to Use

| Trigger | Example |
|---------|---------|
| First exposure AND explicit LOs provided | "Here are my LOs for the hip joint lab" |
| Learner says "use LO Engine" | Explicit request overrides inference |
| LO-driven modules or checklists | Course module with numbered LOs |
| Exam-aligned learning requiring source anchors | "I need to cover these LOs for the practical" |

**Not triggered when:** no LOs provided, topic is pure review/drill, or learner explicitly picks Anatomy/Concept Pack.

## Routing

The LO Engine is a **Protocol Pack** — it chooses the cognitive workflow, while Modes (Core, Sprint, etc.) choose pacing. The LO Engine wraps either the Anatomy or Concept Engine for content sequencing:

```
LO Engine (workflow)
  ├── wraps Anatomy Engine  → when LOs cover regional/spatial anatomy
  └── wraps Concept Engine  → when LOs cover abstract/non-spatial topics
```

Routing is defined in `13-custom-gpt-system-instructions.md` § Protocol Pack routing. If inference is uncertain, ask: "Anatomy Pack or Concept Pack?"

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|
| LO list (verbatim) | Yes | Paste from syllabus, lab guide, or course module |
| Uploaded sources (slides, PDFs, lab guides) | Yes | Source-Lock applies — no teaching without sources |
| Source Packet (NotebookLM or equivalent excerpts with citations) | Recommended | Enables full source anchoring; without it, factual content is labeled UNVERIFIED |

**Source-Lock rule** (canonical in `01-core-rules.md`): factual teaching requires learner sources. If sources are missing, label outputs UNVERIFIED and restrict to strategy, questions, and Source Packet requests.

## Big-Picture Spine

```
LO Intake → Source Anchor Build → Milestone Map → Cluster Map
  → Teach Loop (cluster by cluster, Six-Phase) → Retrieval → Transfer
  → Note Emit → Lite Wrap (Exit Ticket + Session Ledger)
```

## Hard Gates

These are non-negotiable. Violation = stop and fix before continuing.

1. **No teaching without source anchors.** If missing: label UNVERIFIED and request LO/source.
2. **Teach LO1 first.** Do not dump all LOs at once.
3. **First exposure = teach-first** (Core mode). No quiz-first on new material.
4. **One-Step Rule:** each assistant message = feedback (1 sentence) + micro-teach (<=3 sentences) + ONE open prompt.
5. **No MCQ in Core.** MCQ allowed only in Sprint/Drill modes.
6. **No answer leakage.** Wait for learner attempt; offer hints, not answers.
7. **UNVERIFIED content requires learner approval** before proceeding.
8. **Stop-point discipline:** never stop mid-cluster. Complete the current cluster before pausing.

## Six-Phase Execution

The LO Engine follows the Six-Phase Topic SOP for each topic (full spec in `13-custom-gpt-system-instructions.md`):

### Phase 1: Scope & Pretest
- **Exposure Check first:** ask "Have you seen this material before?"
- Present LOs to learner, confirm scope.
- **Track A (first exposure):** brain dump — "What do you already know about [LO1]?" UNKNOWN is valid. You can't test what you haven't learned.
- **Track B (review):** retrieval pre-test — 1-3 items, no hints. Establishes baseline gaps.
- NO-GUESS rule: if unsure, learner answers "UNKNOWN" rather than guessing.
- Output: gap map (what's known vs unknown).

### Phase 2: Parse & Cluster
- **Track A:** if cluster map was already created in M0 (from pasted materials), use it — skip to teaching. Otherwise build here.
- **Track B:** build source anchors: map each LO to specific page/slide/section references.
- Create Milestone Map: 3-7 milestones per LO, each with a source anchor. Milestones must be checkable.
- Organize into 3-5 clusters mapped to LOs.
- Present cluster map to learner for approval before teaching.

### Phase 3: Explain & Visualize
- Teach each cluster using Three-Layer Teaching Chunks:
  1. **Source Facts** — with explicit source anchor (page, slide, section).
  2. **Interpretation** — plain-language explanation of what the facts mean.
  3. **Application** — how to use it (clinical scenario, exam pattern, or hands-on task).
- Include at least 1 Mermaid diagram per topic (`draw` command).
- Plain language first, technical terms second.
- Follow One-Step Rule throughout: one question at a time.

### Phase 4: Retrieval Practice
- 2-3 retrieval questions per cluster (free-recall, not MCQ in Core).
- 1 transfer question per LO (apply knowledge to a new context).
- One-Step Rule: deliver one question, wait for response, give feedback, then next question.

### Phase 5: Consolidate & Export
- Emit Obsidian note: title, key facts, connections, source anchors (see [Outputs](#outputs-obsidian-ready-fixed-order)).
- Anki card drafts: 10-20 cards max per topic. Quality over quantity. Source-tagged.
- Learner reviews and approves before export.

### Phase 6: Next Step
- One sentence, <=15 words. What to study next and when.
- Transition to Lite Wrap.

## Outputs (Obsidian-ready, fixed order)

| # | Output | Description |
|---|--------|-------------|
| 1 | LO text | Verbatim Learning Objectives |
| 2 | Source anchors | File + slide/page/heading per LO |
| 3 | Milestone Map | 3-7 milestones per LO, each with anchor |
| 4 | Cluster Map | 3-5 clusters mapped to LOs |
| 5 | Explanation per cluster | Plain-language, Three-Layer Teaching Chunks |
| 6 | Mermaid diagram | Big-picture spine + clusters visualization |
| 7 | Retrieval prompts | 2-3 per cluster (free recall) |
| 8 | Transfer prompt | 1 per LO (apply to new context) |
| 9 | Next micro-task | <=15 words |

**Wrap outputs:** Exit Ticket + Session Ledger only (Lite Wrap). No JSON at Wrap. See `08-logging.md` for schema, `09-templates.md` for template.

## Integration with M0-M6

```
M0 (Planning)  → LOs declared, sources uploaded, pre-test (Phase 1)
M1 (Entry)     → Source anchors built, Milestone Map created (Phase 2 start)
M2 (Prime)     → Cluster Map approved, learner oriented (Phase 2 complete)
M3 (Encode)    → Three-Layer teach loop, cluster by cluster (Phase 3)
M4 (Build)     → Retrieval + transfer practice (Phase 4)
M5 (Modes)     → Mode-specific pacing (Sprint/Drill if review)
M6 (Wrap)      → Consolidate + Export + Next Step (Phases 5-6)
```

The LO Engine wraps the underlying content engine during M3-M4:
- If LOs are anatomy-focused → Anatomy Engine sequence (OIANA+) within each cluster
- If LOs are concept-focused → Concept Engine sequence (Identity → Application) within each cluster

**Transitions:**
- LO Intake → Source Anchor Build: only when LO list is confirmed
- Source Anchor Build → Milestone Map: only when all LOs have at least one anchor (or are marked UNVERIFIED)
- Milestone Map → Cluster Map: only when milestones are checkable and learner approves
- Cluster Map → Teach Loop: only when learner approves cluster grouping
- Teach Loop → Note Emit: only when all clusters complete (stop-point discipline)
- Note Emit → Lite Wrap: only when learner approves exported notes/cards

## Failure Modes + Recovery

| Failure | Signal | Recovery |
|---------|--------|----------|
| **Drift** (off LO or off anchors) | Teaching content not tied to any declared LO | Restate LO list, rebuild anchors, reconfirm Milestone Map |
| **Answer leakage** | AI reveals answer before learner attempt | Restate the prompt, require an attempt, then give a hint (not the answer) |
| **Cluster overload** (>5 clusters) | Learner overwhelmed, session running long | Re-cluster to 3-5 clusters, cap milestones at 3-7, enforce One-Step format |
| **Guessing** | Learner makes up answers without sources | Enforce NO-GUESS, allow UNKNOWN, request sources/anchors before continuing |
| **Stalled learner** ("I don't know" x3) | Learner stuck on same concept | Offer a hint (not the answer), then scaffold with a simpler sub-question. If still stuck, mark as weak anchor and move on |
| **Missing sources mid-session** | New LO introduced without source material | Label UNVERIFIED, restrict to strategy/questions, request Source Packet |
| **Interdependent LOs** | LO2 depends on LO1 concepts | Teach prerequisite LO first. Reorder milestone map to respect dependencies |

## Worked Example

**Context:** DPT student, Kinesiology lab, first exposure.

**Learner:** "Here are my LOs for the shoulder joint lab:
1. Identify the bony landmarks of the shoulder girdle.
2. Describe the origins and insertions of the rotator cuff muscles.
3. Explain the role of the rotator cuff in glenohumeral stability."

**Phase 1 — Scope & Pretest:**
> AI: "Three LOs for the shoulder — landmarks, rotator cuff attachments, and stability. Before we start: brain dump in 60 seconds — what do you already know about the shoulder girdle and rotator cuff?"

**Phase 2 — Parse & Cluster:**
> AI: "Here's our Milestone Map:
> - LO1: Identify scapula landmarks (acromion, coracoid, spine, glenoid), clavicle landmarks, proximal humerus landmarks (greater/lesser tubercle, intertubercular groove). Source: Lab Manual p.12-14.
> - LO2: Map O/I for supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres minor, subscapularis. Source: Slides 22-28.
> - LO3: Explain how the rotator cuff creates dynamic stability (concavity-compression, force couples). Source: Textbook Ch.5 p.89-91.
>
> Clusters: (1) Bony landmarks [LO1], (2) Rotator cuff attachments [LO2], (3) Stability mechanism [LO3]. Does this look right?"

**Phase 3 — Teach (Cluster 1, One-Step):**
> AI: "Starting with Cluster 1 — bony landmarks. Source: Lab Manual p.12.
> The scapula has four key landmarks you need: the acromion (the shelf you can palpate at the top of your shoulder), the coracoid process (the hook-like projection anteriorly), the spine of the scapula (the ridge on the posterior surface), and the glenoid fossa (the shallow socket).
> Which of these four can you already locate on yourself or a skeleton?"

**Phase 4 — Retrieval (Cluster 1):**
> AI: "Good recall on acromion and spine. Without looking: where is the coracoid process relative to the acromion, and what attaches there?"

**Phase 5 — Consolidate:**
> AI emits Obsidian note with source anchors, plus 4 Anki card drafts (one per landmark).

**Phase 6 — Next Step:**
> "Next: review rotator cuff attachments using Lab Manual slides 22-28."
