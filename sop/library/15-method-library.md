# 15 — Composable Method Library

## §1 Purpose

The Composable Method Library provides reusable, evidence-backed method blocks and pre-built chains for study sessions. Method blocks are atomic study activities (e.g., brain dump, teach-back, retrieval drill). Chains are ordered sequences of blocks designed for specific contexts (e.g., first exposure, exam prep, low energy).

**Goals:**
- **Consistency** — Apply proven methods across sessions
- **Adaptability** — Select chains based on context (class type, stage, energy, time)
- **Evidence** — Every block cites research backing its effectiveness
- **Data** — Rate effectiveness to improve recommendations over time

---

## §2 Method Block Schema

Each method block represents a single study activity.

**Fields:**

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `name` | string | Block name (e.g., "Brain Dump", "Teach-Back") |
| `category` | enum | One of 6 PEIRRO phases (see below) |
| `description` | string | What the block does |
| `duration` | number | Typical minutes required |
| `energy_cost` | enum | `low` / `medium` / `high` |
| `best_stage` | enum | `first_exposure` / `review` / `exam_prep` / `consolidation` |
| `tags` | array | Descriptors (e.g., `["retrieval", "active"]`) |
| `evidence` | string | Research citation (Author, Year; brief finding) |

**Categories (PEIRRO phases):**

1. **Prepare** — Prime attention, surface prior knowledge, build structure (e.g., brain dump, prediction questions, prior knowledge scan, ai skeleton review, concept cluster, three-layer chunk, pre-test)
2. **Encode** — Attach meaning to material (e.g., kwik hook, seed-lock generation, draw-label, teach-back, why-chain, think-aloud protocol, self-explanation protocol, mechanism trace, concept map, comparison table, process flowchart, clinical decision tree)
3. **Retrieve** — Test recall without cues (e.g., free recall blurt, sprint quiz, fill-in-blank, mixed practice, variable retrieval)
4. **Interrogate** — Link to other content, apply, compare (e.g., analogy bridge, clinical application, cross-topic link, side-by-side comparison, case walkthrough, illness script builder)
5. **Refine** — Analyze errors and relearn (e.g., error autopsy, mastery loop)
6. **Overlearn** — Close loop, capture artifacts (e.g., exit ticket, anki card draft)

**Evidence citation format:** `Author (Year); brief finding`

## §5 Rating Protocol

After each session using a method chain, rate its effectiveness.

**Post-Session Rating (captured during Wrap):**

| Field | Scale | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| `effectiveness` | 1-5 | How well did the chain work for this material? |
| `engagement` | 1-5 | How engaged/focused were you? |
| `context_tags` | object | Actual context (class_type, stage, energy, time_available) |
| `notes` | string | Optional free text (e.g., "KWIK worked well; Teach-Back felt rushed") |

**Rating Scale:**

- **1** — Ineffective / disengaged
- **2** — Somewhat ineffective / low engagement
- **3** — Neutral / moderate engagement
- **4** — Effective / high engagement
- **5** — Highly effective / fully engaged

**Capture in Session Ledger:**

Add to `artifacts_created` if a method chain was used:
```
method_chain: [chain_id]; effectiveness: [1-5]; engagement: [1-5]
```

## §6 Context Dimensions

Context tags describe when a chain is appropriate.

| Dimension | Values | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| `class_type` | `anatomy` / `physiology` / `pathology` / `pharmacology` / `clinical` / `general` | Subject type |
| `stage` | `first_exposure` / `review` / `exam_prep` | Learning stage |
| `energy` | `low` / `medium` / `high` | Focus/motivation level (1-10 scale mapped to low=1-4, medium=5-7, high=8-10) |
| `time_available` | number | Minutes available for session |

**Matching Logic:**

Brain recommends chains where context tags align with current session context. Exact matches preferred; partial matches allowed.

---

## §7 Brain Integration

Brain stores and analyzes method chain data.

**Tables:**

1. **method_blocks** — All available blocks (with evidence citations)
2. **method_chains** — Pre-built and custom chains
3. **method_ratings** — Post-session ratings per block and chain

**Analytics:**

- **Effectiveness stats** — Average rating per chain, per context
- **Usage frequency** — Which chains are used most often
- **Anomaly detection** — Flag chains with low ratings in specific contexts
- **Recommendations** — Suggest chains based on session context and historical performance

---

## §8 Scholar Integration

Scholar questions chain effectiveness and proposes improvements.

**Research Questions:**

1. Which blocks correlate with high retention (from RSR data)?
2. Do certain chains work better for specific class types?
3. Are there context patterns where effectiveness is consistently low?
4. Can we predict optimal chain selection based on past sessions?

**Outputs:**

- **Chain Optimization Proposals** — Reorder blocks, swap blocks, adjust durations
- **New Chain Designs** — Propose chains for underserved contexts
- **A/B Test Plans** — Compare variant chains in similar contexts

---

## Cross-References

- **Core Rules:** `01-core-rules.md` (planning, source-lock, seed-lock gates apply during method execution)
- **Session Flow:** `05-session-flow.md` (method chains run inside M2-M4; selection occurs during M0 Planning)
- **Modes:** `06-modes.md` (chains can be mode-specific; e.g., Sprint chains use retrieval-first blocks)
- **Logging:** `08-logging.md` (method_chain field added to Session Ledger and Enhanced JSON)
- **Templates:** `09-templates.md` (method_chain added to Session Ledger template)

---

## Implementation Notes

- Method chains are **optional**. Sessions can proceed without selecting a chain.
- Chains are **composable** — blocks can be reordered or omitted as needed.
- **Ad-hoc chains** can be built during M0 Planning if no template fits.
- Rating is **opt-in** but recommended for data-driven improvement.
- All blocks include evidence citations. Use `--force` re-seed to update.
- Use `--migrate` flag to update categories on an existing database without wiping data.
