# Elaborative Interrogation

## What It Means
Asking "how" and "why" questions about material, then generating your own explanations. Forces you to connect new information to existing knowledge.

---

## Why It Works

### The Connection Principle
Information sticks when connected to existing knowledge. Isolated facts are fragile. Networked knowledge is durable.

### The Generation Effect
Self-generated explanations are remembered far better than passively received information. Your brain owns what it creates.

### The Processing Depth
Asking "why" forces deeper processing than "what." Shallow processing = weak encoding. Deep processing = strong encoding.

## How to Do It

### Step 1: Encounter a Fact
"The ACL prevents anterior tibial translation."

### Step 2: Ask Why/How
- "WHY does it prevent that motion?"
- "HOW does its structure accomplish this function?"

### Step 3: Generate Your Answer
- "Because it runs diagonally from posterior femur to anterior tibia, so when the tibia tries to slide forward, the ligament gets taut and stops it — like a seatbelt."

### Step 4: Verify
Check if your explanation is accurate. Correct if needed.

## Seed-Lock IS Elaborative Interrogation

The Seed-Lock mechanism in this system is elaborative interrogation:

| Elaborative Interrogation | Seed-Lock |
|---------------------------|-----------|
| Ask why/how | "Why does this work?" |
| Generate explanation | User supplies hook/metaphor |
| Connect to prior knowledge | User's connection, not AI's |
| Verify understanding | AI validates or molds |

**That's why Seed-Lock works:** It's forcing the exact cognitive process that creates durable learning.

## Common Questions to Ask

### Function Questions
- Why does [X] work this way?
- What's the purpose of [X]?
- How does [X] accomplish its function?

### Mechanism Questions
- What happens when [X] is triggered?
- How does [X] lead to [Y]?
- What's the step-by-step process?

### Connection Questions
- How does this relate to [something I know]?
- What would happen if [X] failed?
- How is this similar to / different from [Y]?

### Clinical Questions (PT specific)
- What would I see if this fails?
- How would I test for this?
- What's the rehabilitation implication?

## When It Works Best

**Works well when:**
- You have some prior knowledge to connect to
- The material has causal relationships
- You can verify your explanations

**Works less well when:**
- Material is completely novel (no connections to make)
- Content is arbitrary (no logical "why")
- No feedback available

**In this system:** Priming (M2) builds the scaffold first, so you have structure to connect new encoding to.

## Compared to Other Strategies

| Strategy | Depth | Effort | Retention |
|----------|-------|--------|-----------|
| Re-reading | Shallow | Low | Poor |
| Highlighting | Shallow | Low | Poor |
| Summarizing | Medium | Medium | Medium |
| Elaborative Interrogation | Deep | High | Excellent |
| Retrieval Practice | Deep | High | Excellent |

**Best approach:** Combine elaborative interrogation (during encoding) with retrieval practice (for consolidation).

## Application in This System

| Phase | Elaborative Interrogation |
|-------|---------------------------|
| M3 (Encode) | "What's the FUNCTION?" forces why |
| Seed-Lock | User generates own explanation |
| L2 Teach-back | "Explain simply" requires elaboration |
| M4 (Build) | Connect across levels |

---

## The Key Constraint

**You must actually answer the questions.**

Asking "why" without generating an answer doesn't help. The cognitive work happens in the generation, not the question.

That's why "Okay" is not a valid Seed. That's why Gated Platter demands you EDIT, not just accept.
