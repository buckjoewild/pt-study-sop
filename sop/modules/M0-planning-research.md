# M0 Planning – Research Notes (v9.1)

Purpose: Capture evidence and ready-to-use material to strengthen `M0-planning.md` without cluttering the module file.

## Key Findings
- Pre-testing / pre-questioning improves later retention; effects grow over longer intervals (strong after ~1 week).  
- PT/anatomy: brief pre-lab quizzes (covering upcoming dissection content) improved lab exams, written tests, and overall course grades in PT students.  
- Planning quality matters: concrete, realistic plans drive engagement; vague plans do little.  
- Microlearning: 10–15 minute, tightly scoped sessions can boost outcomes when paired with active recall.  
- “Struggle-first” practice (attempt before instruction) in clinical skills led to faster, fewer-error performance versus instruction-first.

## Planning Checklist (ready to drop into M0)
1) Define a specific, achievable session goal.  
2) Do a 1–3 item pre-test or brain dump to prime gaps.  
3) List sources and the highest-priority subtopics.  
4) Allocate time blocks (and a midpoint check if >30 min).  
5) Choose active methods (questions, flashcards, sketch/label, teach-back).  
6) Midpoint checkpoint: quick recall; adjust if off-track.  
7) Wrap: final self-test/summary + note follow-ups.

## Session Templates
**Quick Plan (30–60 min)**  
- Goal → 5 min pre-test/brain dump → 20–40 min study/practice chunks (active) → midpoint check (if ≥45 min) → 5 min wrap/test.

**Micro-Plan (10–15 min)**  
- Micro-goal → 2–3 min recall → 5–8 min targeted review → 2–3 min re-recall → 1 min note next step.

## Risks & Mitigations
- Demoralization from pre-test misses → frame as diagnostic; give immediate answers; keep low-stakes.  
- Over-ambitious/rigid plans → set realistic micro-goals; leave buffer; adjust on the fly.  
- Planning overload → use the 7-step checklist; limit planning to ~2 minutes; pick 1–2 active methods per session.

## Placement Plan
- Add “Evidence” and “Session Templates” sections to `M0-planning.md` using the above.  
- Add a one-liner in `runtime-prompt.md` to remind assistants to run a 1–3 item pre-test and mark unverified answers as such.
