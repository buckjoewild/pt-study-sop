# M3 Encode – Research Notes (v9.1)

Scope: Evidence-based encoding strategies across subjects, with applicability to anatomy/clinical reasoning.

## Key Findings
- Dual coding: Combining verbal + visuals yields ~0.5 SD gain vs. text alone; strong for diagrams/animations.
- Worked examples: Large novice benefit (meta g≈0.48); correct examples > incorrect. Faded examples help transition to independent problem-solving.
- Self-explanation / elaborative interrogation: Prompts to explain “why/how” improve learning/transfer (meta g≈0.55).
- Drawing/generative notes: Drawing helps when guided; unsupported drawing can add load. Supported drawing shows modest gains (g≈0.35).
- Errorful generation: Productive when followed by feedback; in precision domains (anatomy), ensure rapid correction to avoid fossilizing errors.
- Cognitive load: Segmenting complex media and signaling key info improves retention/transfer; pre-train basics to reduce intrinsic load.
- Timing: Quality over duration; in 30–60 min sessions, 15–20 min focused encoding before practice; in 10–15 min micro-sessions, use 1–2 active tactics (sketch+explain or read+paraphrase).

## Encode Toolkit (actions to embed in M3)
- Dual-code & draw: Pair text with diagrams; ask learners to sketch or annotate while reading.
- Example–problem pairs: Study a worked example, then a near-transfer problem; use faded steps as learners progress.
- Self-explain prompts: Insert “why/how” questions after each chunk or diagram.
- Segment & paraphrase: Break content into small chunks; pause to restate in own words before proceeding.
- Generate & check: Have learners predict/label/fill blanks, then reveal correct answers immediately.
- Immediate self-checks: Quick concept questions/flashcards after each chunk to catch misconceptions early.

## Fading Guidance
- Start with fully worked examples; shift to partial (fill-in steps/labels); then to full problems. Cue to fade when learners can explain steps without looking or fill blanks with high accuracy. Avoid abrupt jumps.

## Timing Notes
- 30–60 min: ~15–20 min active encoding, interleaved with short recall/quiz breaks; switch activities every ~15 min to maintain attention.
- 10–15 min: One focused mini-cycle (e.g., read 2–3 min + sketch/label 3–4 min + 1–2 min self-explain/recall).

## Risks & Mitigations
- Overload → segment, simplify visuals, pre-train key terms, use signaling.  
- Passive copying → force paraphrase/predict/label steps; embed self-checks.  
- Misconceptions → provide immediate feedback; for high-precision facts, use errorless first exposure or quick correction.  
- Illusion of knowing → require recall/teach-back; use spaced rechecks.

## Placement Plan
- Add “Encode Toolkit” + “Evidence” to `M3-encode.md`.
- Add fading guidance section.
- Add brief timing guidance for full vs. micro sessions.
- Add a short “Risks & mitigations” box.
