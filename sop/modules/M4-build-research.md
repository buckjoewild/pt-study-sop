# M4 Build – Research Notes (v9.1)

Scope: Difficulty ramp, practice design, feedback, and consolidation; applies to conceptual discrimination (e.g., anatomy ID, diagnoses) and procedural skills (clinical reasoning, techniques).

## Key Findings
- Spacing: Distributed practice markedly improves long-term retention; spaced retrieval in health-sci/anatomy boosts outcomes.
- Retrieval practice: Frequent active recall beats re-reading for retention and application.
- Interleaving: Mixing related items improves discrimination/transfer (meta g≈0.4 overall; larger for similar visuals); blocking can help initial fluency for basics/unrelated facts.
- Variability/contextual interference: Varied practice (different cases/contexts/parameters) slows acquisition but improves retention/transfer; useful for PT motor/clinical skills.
- Progressive difficulty & scaffolding: Guided → faded → independent practice builds schema and prevents overload; successive relearning (repeat mastery across sessions) strengthens retention.
- Feedback timing: Immediate for critical errors to prevent fossilization; slight delays can deepen learning for complex reasoning—always include explanation.
- Error management: Allow errors with rapid correction can build adaptive expertise; errorless approaches suit high-risk basics but may reduce transfer; balance based on risk and novelty.

## Build Toolkit (actions to embed in M4)
- Interleave similar-but-different items (structures, diagnoses) once basics are known.
- Space practice: revisit key items multiple times within and across sessions; use successive relearning (3+ successful recalls).
- Progressive ladder: guided easy → partial support → independent complex; gate advancement by accuracy/explanation.
- Varied exemplars: practice skills across varied patients/contexts/angles to build flexibility.
- Frequent retrieval & self-explanation during practice (teach-back, “why/how”).
- Feedback with hints→answers+explanations; immediate on factual/safety errors, brief delay OK for reflection.
- Error reflection: quick debrief of mistakes to convert them to learning.

## Difficulty Ramp Template
- Stage 1: Simple + high support (worked examples/templates/hints).  
- Stage 2: Medium complexity + faded support (partial examples, fewer hints).  
- Stage 3: Full complexity, independent; simulate real conditions.  
- Stage 4: Spaced reinforcement/overlearning (later quick reviews).

## Timing
- 30–60 min session: 3 x ~15 min mixed segments; include a 5 min break; space key items at start/mid/end; reserve 5–10 min debrief.  
- 10–15 min micro: one narrow objective; high-intensity recall/drill; rapid feedback; acts as spaced booster.

## Risks & Mitigations
- Overload/fatigue → segment, short breaks, warm-up before hardest tasks.  
- Over-randomization → controlled interleaving; maintain coherence.  
- Shortcut/passive practice → switch MCQ to free recall; remove hints over time; require reasoning.  
- Error fossilization → timely correction; address common errors to group.  
- Confidence erosion → gradual ramp, normalize errors, celebrate small wins.  
- Individual differences → optional challenge items; remediation loops before advancing.

## Placement Plan
- Add “Build Toolkit,” difficulty ramp, timing, and risks sections to `M4-build.md`.  
- Emphasize interleaving/spacing/variability guidance and feedback rules.
