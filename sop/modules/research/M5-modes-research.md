# M5 Modes – Research Notes (v9.1)

Scope: Mode selection and switching for individual self-study (with notes usable for group/class); Core (learn+practice), Sprint (test-first/exam-sim), Drill (targeted remediation).

## Key Findings
- Practice testing: Meta-analyses show moderate–large benefits (g≈0.5–0.7) for retention and transfer; mock exams outperform restudy and often outperform pretests for final retention.
- Pretesting: Attempting answers before study can prime learning, but full post-study practice tests still give the strongest end outcomes.
- Targeted remediation (successive relearning): Spaced retrieval to mastery on weak items boosts exam scores by ~1 letter grade vs. restudy; feedback on errors is essential.
- Blended Core: Mixing study + retrieval + explanatory feedback improves understanding and transfer more than either alone.
- Adaptive switching: Mastery thresholds (~80%+ accuracy) cue progression; low accuracy or persistent conceptual errors cue return to Core; specific weak items cue Drill. Confidence/accuracy mismatches help detect illusions of knowing.
- Fatigue: Performance drops with prolonged intensive testing; short breaks (20–30 min) restore performance; optimal focus chunks ~20–30 min (Pomodoro-like) with a larger break after ~45–60 min.
- Health-sci evidence: Frequent low-stakes quizzes/mock exams and mastery learning cut-scores improve medical/health exam performance; retrieval + spaced review beats reread; targeted drills on weakest topics outperform equal-time reread.

## Mode Rules (when to use)
- Core: New/complex material; conceptual confusion; post-Sprint debrief; general baseline study. Exit when you can recall/apply ~80% with understanding.
- Sprint: Timed, closed-book retrieval for diagnosis or capstone; use to surface gaps or build exam stamina. Exit if ≥80–90% (ready) or if fatigue/low score → switch to Drill/Core.
- Drill: Focused weak items (<70% or repeatedly forgotten); successive relearning until multiple correct recalls. Exit when stable high accuracy/confidence; schedule spaced revisits.

## Mode Playbooks
- Core (30–45 min): 15 min learn → 10 min recall/apply → 5 min feedback; repeat. Micro (15 min): 5 learn + 5 recall + 5 check. Use elaboration and brief application.
- Sprint: Full (30–60 min) timed mixed questions; immediate scoring; thorough review of errors. Micro (10–15 min): 5–10 timed items + quick feedback. Use real exam conditions.
- Drill: Small target set; loop with immediate feedback until 2–3 correct recalls; mini-spacing within set; revisit next day. Keep sets short; stop when diminishing returns, resume later.

## Switching Criteria
- Objective: Accuracy thresholds (e.g., Sprint <70% → Drill; item <60–70% → Drill; topic ~80%+ → Sprint or move on). Time-to-recall slow → schedule Drill.
- Subjective: Low confidence despite high accuracy → brief Sprint to calibrate; high confidence but low accuracy → Core + Drill; signs of fatigue → break or switch to lighter Core.
- Error pattern: Conceptual errors → Core (re-learn); memory slips → Drill; broad poor performance → Core review before more testing.

## Timing
- Sprint/Drill bursts: 10–15 min high-intensity; full Sprint up to ~30 min, then break.  
- Core blocks: 15–20 min study cycles; in 60-min session include a 5–10 min break.  
- Long blocks (2–3 hrs): split into 3×45–50 min with 10–15 min breaks.

## Risks & Mitigations
- Over-testing/burnout → limit Sprint frequency/length; insert breaks; vary tasks.  
- Shallow recall → pair retrieval with explanation; include application items.  
- Drilling wrong things → base Drill targets on Sprint/Core data; rotate in high-yield topics.  
- Illusions of knowing → mix formats, use spaced retests, require free recall.  
- Fatigue → scheduled breaks; alternate hard/easy tasks; stop when accuracy falls.

## Placement Plan
- Add “Mode Rules,” “Playbooks,” switching criteria, timing, and risks to `M5-modes.md`.  
- Include quick reference thresholds (e.g., 80–90% mastery → advance; <70% → remediate).
