# M6 Wrap – Research Notes (v9.1)

Scope: Individual self-study wrap-ups (2–10 minutes), with notes adaptable to group/peer debriefs.

## Key Findings
- Self-explanation/teach-back: Brief post-lesson self-explanation yields moderate gains (meta g≈0.55) and improves transfer.
- Retrieval > reread at wrap: Ending with active recall (summary, 1–3 quiz items, one-minute paper) outperforms passive re-read for retention.
- Error review: Immediate feedback/error review beats delayed; “exam wrappers” alone are mixed—engagement with errors matters. Personalized error logs improve subsequent performance when reviewed.
- Spacing & planning: Spaced follow-ups (e.g., 1d/3d/7d) significantly boost long-term retention (d≈0.6 in health-pro RCTs). Setting a specific next-review plan increases adherence (implementation intentions effect).
- Calibration: Confidence/JOL checks help detect over/underconfidence; pairing ratings with a quick test improves metacognitive accuracy and study efficiency.
- Sleep proximity: Studying/reviewing before sleep modestly improves next-day recall; do not trade off sleep quantity.

## Wrap Toolkit (2–10 min routines)
- 3-Question Recap: What 1–3 key things? Where was an error/confusion? What to change next time?
- One-Minute Paper: 60s summary from memory (no notes).
- Teach-Back: 1–2 min aloud/recorded explanation of the core idea.
- Error Log Entry: Note each mistake + correct concept/solution; tag for re-quiz.
- Next-Session Plan: Set next review time/content (e.g., 1d/3d/7d) and a tiny goal.

## Calibration Checklist
- Rate confidence per objective (e.g., 1–5).  
- Mini-test (one rep question/recall).  
- Compare confidence vs performance; mark over/underestimates.  
- Adjust plan (drill items with overconfidence errors; reinforce underconfident-but-correct items lightly).

## Spacing / Next-Step Template
- Review 1: ~24h later (5–10 min, active recall).  
- Review 2: ~3 days later (10 min, mixed questions/recall).  
- Review 3: ~7 days later (10–15 min, fuller self-test/teach-back).  
- Successive relearning: require 2–3 correct recalls across spaced sessions before “mastered”; then extend interval.
- Begin next session with prior wrap outputs (summary/error log) as a warm-up.

## Timing Guidance
- Standard session (30–60 min): 5–10 min wrap; keep it concise and active.  
- Micro-session (<15 min): 2–3 min wrap (one mini recall + note next review).

## Risks & Mitigations
- Overlong wrap → cap time; use a timer; focus on 1–2 high-yield actions.  
- Shallow summaries → write from memory, not notes; check and fill gaps after.  
- Miscalibrated confidence → always pair ratings with a quick test.  
- Ignored outputs → surface wrap notes in the next session; set calendar reminders for spaced reviews.  
- Fatigue → keep wrap brief; if tired, do one recall + schedule next review, then stop.

## Placement Plan
- Add “Wrap Toolkit,” spacing template, and calibration checklist to `M6-wrap.md`.  
- Insert a short reminder to log errors and schedule next review at session end.
