# M0: Planning (Session Setup)

## Purpose
Establish clear targets, gather materials, and create a plan before any teaching. Planning is mandatory for substantive sessions.

---
## Planning Rule
> No teaching until we have: target, sources, a 3-5 step plan, and a 1-3 item pre-test or brain dump.

---
## Planning Protocol
1) TARGET: What exam/block is this for? How much time do we have?
2) POSITION: What is covered vs remaining? Any known weak spots?
3) MATERIALS: LOs, slides, labs, practice questions, notes.
4) SOURCE-LOCK: List the specific materials used today (pages/links).
   - If no sources are provided, mark output as unverified and keep claims cautious.
   - A NotebookLM Source Packet with excerpts and citations satisfies Source-Lock.
5) INTERLEAVE: Review 1-2 weak anchors from the prior session (Wrap Watchlist).
6) PLAN: 3-5 steps for this session.
7) GLOSSARY SCAN: List the top 5 terms; define each at L2 before proceeding.
8) PRIME: Run 1-3 pre-questions or a 60-120s brain dump on today's target.

---
## Weekly Rotation (3+2)
Use the 3+2 cluster system when planning a full week. See `sop/master_rotational_interleaving_system.md`.

- Cluster A: 3 most technical classes.
- Cluster B: 2 lighter or reading-heavy classes.
- Weekly rhythm:
  - Mon/Wed/Fri: Deep work on Cluster A + 15 min review of Cluster B.
  - Tue/Thu/Sat: Deep work on Cluster B + 15 min review of Cluster A.
  - Sun: Weekly review and metacognition.

If planning a single session, note which cluster it belongs to and add the 15 min cross-review to the plan.

## Interleaving (confusables list)
Interleaving is for discrimination among confusable items within a class.
During planning, list 3-5 confusable pairs/groups to mix later (after initial understanding).
Examples: similar muscle actions, similar pathways, look-alike steps.

## Retrospective timetable upkeep
Update the R/Y/G status for each key item after each review.
Template: `sop/src/templates/retrospective_timetable.md`.

---
## Checklists
**Session Inputs**
- [ ] Target clear (exam/block + time)
- [ ] Position known (covered vs remaining; weak spots)
- [ ] Interleaving check complete (prior weak anchors reviewed)
- [ ] Materials in hand (LOs/slides/labs/practice Qs/notes)
- [ ] Source-Lock declared (specific pages/files for today)
- [ ] Plan of attack (3-5 steps)
- [ ] Pre-test/brain dump done (1-3 items)

**Quick Plan Templates**
- Standard (30-60 min): goal + 5-10 min pre-test/brain dump + 2-3 active chunks + midpoint check + 5-10 min wrap.
- Micro (10-15 min): micro-goal + 1-2 min recall + 5-8 min targeted work + 2-3 min re-recall + 1 min next step.

---
## Mode Alignment
- Core: full planning.
- Sprint/Quick Sprint: abbreviated plan (targets + time + source-lock + prime).
- Light: micro plan template.
- Drill: identify specific weak spot + source-lock + narrow plan.

---
## Exit Condition
Planning is complete when target, sources, plan, and pre-test are confirmed; then move to M1 -> M2.


## Source: src\modules\M1-entry.md

# M1: Entry (Session Initialization)

## Purpose
Establish session state, select operating mode, and load any prior context before learning begins.

---
## Entry Checklist

### 1) State Check
Ask the user:
- "Focus level 1-10?"
- "Energy/motivation today?"

Why: Low focus (1-4) may warrant shorter session or Sprint/Light mode. High focus supports deep Core work.

### 2) Scope Check
Confirm:
- Topic: specific subject/chapter/concept
- Materials: lecture, textbook, notes, practice questions
- Time: how long do we have

Why: Defines what is achievable and prevents scope creep.

### 3) Mode Selection

| User State | Recommended Mode |
| --- | --- |
| "Haven't studied this" / "New to me" | Core |
| "I've seen it, test me" / "Exam soon" | Sprint |
| "I only have 10-15 min" | Light |
| "Give me a 20-30 min test burst" | Quick Sprint |
| "I keep missing [specific thing]" | Drill |

Ask directly: "Have you studied this before, or is it new?"

### 4) Context Load
- Resuming -> user pastes resume or describes where they left off
- Fresh start -> proceed to M2 (Prime)

---
## Mode Behaviors

### Core Mode (Guided Learning)
- AI leads with priming
- Full Prime -> Encode -> Build sequence
- Scaffolding available
- Best for new material

### Sprint Mode (Test-First)
- AI asks, user answers
- Correct -> next item
- Wrong -> stop, build hook, retry
- No teaching unless triggered by miss
- Best for exam prep

### Light Mode (10-15 min)
- Single micro objective
- Short recall cycle + minimal wrap

### Quick Sprint (20-30 min)
- Timed burst; rapid questions
- Wrap required with 3-5 cards from misses

### Drill Mode (Deep Practice)
- Focus on specific weak areas
- User leads reconstruction
- Heavy phonetic hooks
- Best for stubborn gaps

```

---
## Exit Condition
- Mode selected
- Scope defined
- Ready to proceed to M2 (Prime) or appropriate mode entry


## Source: src\modules\M2-prime.md

# M2: Prime (Map the Territory)

## Purpose
Map the structure before encoding. Build buckets; do not memorize yet. Prime aligns with the Prepare phase of PEIRRO.

---
## Ingestion Sandwich (Pre-lecture step)
If this session is tied to a lecture or reading, do a short pre-lecture skim:
- Scan headings, learning objectives, and figures.
- Write 5 pretest questions (no answers yet).
- Write 1 prior-knowledge link.
- Note the top 5 terms and 2-3 likely buckets.
- Goal: a schema scaffold, not detail.

(Default: ~15 minutes; adjust as needed.)

---
## Prime Protocol (fast)
1) H1 scan (default): System -> Subsystem -> Component -> Element (<=6 bullets or 2 short paragraphs).
2) Buckets: ask the user to group into 2-4 buckets (spatial/mechanism/compare/contrast/workflow/timeline).
3) Select the first bucket to encode.
4) Optional H2 (structure-first) only if user explicitly requests traditional anatomy order.
5) If not already done: 1-3 pre-questions or a 60-120s brain dump.

---
## Toolkit
- Label-a-diagram prime: show unlabeled schema; have learner label from memory, then reveal/correct.
- Prediction prompt: "What do you think happens/attaches/functions here..." before teaching.
- Quick glossary: define top 3-5 terms at L2 before deep encoding.

---
## Guardrails
- Do not teach details during Prime; keep it a map.
- Keep scans tight; mark unverified if no source provided.
- Bucket first, then encode; 2-3 buckets max for a session.

---
## Exit Condition
- H-series scan done
- Buckets chosen
- First bucket selected
- Pre-questions answered and corrected
- Ready for M3 (Encode)


## Source: src\modules\M3-encode.md

# M3: Encode (Attach Meaning)

## Purpose
Turn mapped buckets into understanding using function-first framing and active generation. Learner supplies the Seed; AI does not build without it.

---
## Ingestion Sandwich (Active + Post)
During lecture/reading (active encoding):
- Minimal structure map for the topic.
- One small diagram.
- One example and one boundary case.
- Cornell or flow notes (questions on the left, ideas on the right).
- Frequent "why/how" prompts to force self-explanation.

Within 24 hours (post-lecture):
- Answer 3 why/how prompts.
- Do 5 retrieval prompts from memory.
- Create cards for misses.
- Use `sop/src/templates/post_lecture_elaboration_prompts.md`.

---
## KWIK Flow (default for hooks)
Sound -> Function -> Image -> Resonance -> Lock

Enforcement:
1) Capture phonetic seed (sound-alike).
2) State true function/action.
3) Build imagery tied to that function.
4) User confirms resonance ("sounds right" and "feels right").
5) Lock the hook (card/log) before moving on.

---
## Encode Toolkit
- Dual code: words + visuals; ask for sketches/annotations.
- Example -> problem pairs: show a worked example, then a near-transfer problem; fade steps over time.
- Self-explain prompts: after each chunk/diagram, ask "why/how".
- Segment & paraphrase: break into small chunks; learner restates in their own words.
- Generate & check: predict/label/fill blanks, then reveal immediately.
- Quick self-checks: 1-3 recall questions after each chunk.

---
## Guardrails
- Do not advance without the learner's Seed/approval.
- Function before structure; image only after meaning.
- Keep outputs concise; mark unverified if no source provided.

---
## Exit Condition
- Bucket encoded with generation + feedback
- Learner can explain in their own words
- Hooks locked where needed
- Ready for Build/Practice (M4) or next bucket


## Source: src\modules\M4-build.md

# M4: Build (Practice and Transfer)

## Purpose
Practice with increasing difficulty, spacing, and variability. Lock understanding and transfer.

---
## Build Toolkit
- Interleave: mix similar-but-different items once basics are known.
- Space: revisit key items multiple times within and across the session (successive relearning).
- Variability: practice across varied cases/angles/contexts to improve transfer.
- Progressive ladder: guided -> partial support -> independent -> spaced reinforcement.
- Retrieval + self-explanation: frequent recall with "why/how" reasoning.
- Feedback: immediate on factual errors; brief delay is OK for reasoning.
- Error reflection: note each miss + correction; use for Wrap/cards.

---
## Level Gating (see `sop/src/frameworks/levels.md`)
- L1 (metaphor) and L2 (10-year-old) are open.
- L2 teach-back is required before L4 clinical detail.

---
## Build Protocol
1) Confirm Seed lock from M3.
2) L2 teach-back (required gate).
3) L3 and L4 detail only after L2 passes.
4) Apply practice ladder: worked -> completion -> independent -> spaced reinforcement.
5) Capture misses for Wrap.

---
## Anatomy Drawing Integration
If anatomy and requested, provide drawing steps:
- Base shape -> steps -> labels -> function
- Use clock positions/fractions for placement

---
## Exit Condition
- Learner handles mixed/varied items with accuracy and reasoning
- 2-3 correct spaced recalls on key items
- Ready for Wrap (M6) or next bucket


## Source: src\modules\M5-modes.md

# M5: Modes (Operating Behavior Modifiers)

## Purpose
Define how AI behavior changes by mode and give quick presets for short sessions.

---
## Mode Selection Heuristic

| User Says | Mode | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| "Haven't studied this" / "It's new" | Core | Needs structure and scaffolding |
| "Quiz me" / "Test my knowledge" / "Exam prep" | Sprint | Gap-finding under time pressure |
| "I only have 10-15 min" | Light | Micro-session |
| "Give me a 20-30 min test burst" | Quick Sprint | Timed Sprint with required wrap |
| "I keep missing this" | Drill | Specific weak area |

---
## Core Mode (Guided Learning)
- AI leads: Prime -> Encode -> Build; provides H1 scan; enforces Seed-Lock.
- Characteristics: more teaching, scaffolds, metaphors offered for user to edit.

## Sprint Mode (Test-First)
- AI tests first; teaches only on miss; rapid-fire.
- Flow: Question -> Answer -> [correct: next] / [wrong: hook + retry].

## Quick Sprint (20-30 min)
- Mini-plan: landmarks -> attachments -> OIANA+ (Actions -> Nerves -> Arterial supply).
- 8-10 timed recalls/questions.
- Wrap: require 3-5 cards from misses; log next review.

## Light Mode (10-15 min)
- Scope: one tiny objective.
- Flow: landmarks -> attachments; ~5 recalls.
- Wrap: 1-3 cards, one-sentence summary, schedule next check.

## Drill Mode (Deep Practice)
- User leads reconstruction; AI spots gaps; demands multiple hooks/examples.
- Flow: Identify weak spot -> reconstruct -> flag gaps -> rebuild hooks -> test variations -> lock.

---
## Mode Switching
Commands: `mode core`, `mode sprint`, `mode quick-sprint`, `mode light`, `mode drill`.

Switch heuristics:
- Core -> Sprint when learner reports high confidence.
- Sprint -> Drill when repeated misses cluster on one concept.
- Sprint -> Core when understanding is shaky.
- Drill -> Sprint when learner feels solid.
- Insert breaks if fatigue or accuracy drops.

---
## Mode Comparison

| Aspect | Core | Sprint | Quick Sprint | Light | Drill |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| AI role | Guide | Tester | Tester (short) | Guide (micro) | Spotter |
| Pace | Moderate | Fast | Fast, time-boxed | Fast, micro | Slow/thorough |
| Teaching | Yes | On miss | On miss | Minimal | On demand |
| Default scope | Full topic | Broad | Narrow timed set | Single micro target | Single weak spot |
| Wrap cards | 1-3 | 3-5 from misses | 3-5 | 1-3 | 2-4 from rebuild |

---
## Example Command Cues
- `ready` (next step)
- `bucket` (group)
- `mold` (fix logic)
- `wrap` (end)
- `mode <x>` (switch)
- `mnemonic` (3 options after understanding)

---
## Safety / Defaults
- Seed-Lock required; reject passive acceptance.
- Function before structure; mark unverified if no source.
- Sprint/Drill still operate inside PEIRRO and may call KWIK for encoding steps.


## Source: src\modules\M6-wrap.md

# M6: Wrap (Close and Schedule)

## Purpose
End-of-session consolidation in 2-10 minutes: recall, error capture, cards, metrics, and next-review plan. Wrap aligns with PEIRRO Refine and Overlearn.

---
## Final 10 minutes (mandatory)
1) Free recall blurt (2 minutes, notes closed).
2) Muddiest point: name the single fuzziest concept.
3) Next action hook: write the first action for next session.

Template: `sop/src/templates/exit_ticket.md`

---
## Wrap Protocol
1) Anchors review: list all hooks locked today.
2) Cards: create Anki-style cards for misses/weak anchors (required).
3) Metrics capture:
   - Calibration gap (confidence vs recall)
   - Retrieval success rate (RSR %)
   - Cognitive load type (intrinsic/extraneous/germane)
   - Transfer check (connected to another class? yes/no)
4) Spaced retrieval schedule (1-3-7-21) using active recall, not rereading.
   - Use the retrospective timetable (red/yellow/green) to adjust spacing.
   - Template: `sop/src/templates/retrospective_timetable.md`
5) Output logs per schema v9.3 (Tracker JSON + Enhanced JSON).
   - Schema: `sop/logging_schema_v9.3.md`

---
## Spaced Retrieval Defaults (heuristic)
- Review 1: +1 day
- Review 2: +3 days
- Review 3: +7 days
- Review 4: +21 days

Adjust intervals based on retrospective status:
- Red (struggled): sooner review
- Yellow (effortful success): keep standard spacing
- Green (easy): extend interval

---
## Calibration Check
- Predict your score (0-100%) on today's target.
- Answer one application question.
- Compare prediction vs actual; adjust spacing if overconfident.

---
## Exit Condition
- Exit ticket completed
- Cards captured
- Metrics logged
- Spaced reviews scheduled
- Tracker JSON + Enhanced JSON output complete
