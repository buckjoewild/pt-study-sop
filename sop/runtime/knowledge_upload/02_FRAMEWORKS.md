# Learning Cycle: PEIRRO + KWIK

Two interlocking loops drive all learning in this SOP. PEIRRO is the macro cycle (session-level). KWIK is the micro-loop (encoding-level) that nests inside PEIRRO's Encode phase.

---

## PEIRRO — Macro Learning Cycle

**What:** Six-phase cycle that structures every full study session from orientation through long-term retention.

**Pattern:** Prepare -> Encode -> Interrogate -> Retrieve -> Refine -> Overlearn

### Steps

| Phase | Action | Key Rule |
|-------|--------|----------|
| **1. Prepare** | Clarify scope, relevance, and expectations before learning begins | Orient attention first — never dive straight into content |
| **2. Encode** | Actively build durable schemas by linking new material to prior knowledge using multimodal cues (imagery + meaning) | KWIK activates here for memory hooks |
| **3. Interrogate** | Question and explain "why/how" to deepen understanding | Self-explanation, not passive review |
| **4. Retrieve** | Effortful recall without cues | No new information introduced — pure recall |
| **5. Refine** | Correct errors and misconceptions using retrieval feedback | Address gaps before moving on |
| **6. Overlearn** | Continued spaced recall beyond initial mastery | Stabilizes knowledge for long-term retention |

### Execution Rules

- Use PEIRRO as the core learning cycle for all sessions.
- Do not skip phases when running full sessions.
- Phases are sequential — each depends on the prior phase's output.

## KWIK — Encoding Micro-Loop

**What:** Five-step gated process that creates memory hooks by anchoring a phonetic cue to function, then imagery, then a locked artifact.

**Pattern:** Sound -> Function -> Image -> Resonance -> Lock

### Steps

| Step | Action | Gate Condition |
|------|--------|----------------|
| **1. Sound** | Capture a phonetic seed or sound-alike hook | Hook identified before proceeding |
| **2. Function** | State the true function/action of the term | Word + meaning paired before imagery |
| **3. Image** | Build imagery tied directly to the confirmed function | Image anchored to function, not just sound |
| **4. Resonance** | Confirm the hook "sounds right" and "feels right" | Learner approval required — never skip |
| **5. Lock** | Record the hook as a card or log entry | Artifact logged before moving on |

### When KWIK Activates

- During PEIRRO Phase 2 (Encode) when turning mapped buckets into memory hooks.
- For complex or new terms needing a sound-alike hook before meaning.
- Whenever a Seed-Lock or card must be gated through resonance.

### Execution Rules

- Must pair word + meaning before imagery (Function before Image).
- Must gate each step — no skipping ahead.
- Must log a lock (card/hook) before exiting Lock.
- Never skip resonance confirmation.
- Never advance without learner approval for the current step.

### Evidence Signals

- **Helping:** Fast recall with correct meaning; imagery triggers function.
- **Hurting:** Image recalled but meaning forgotten; confusion between similar items.

## How They Connect

```
PEIRRO Session
  1. Prepare
  2. Encode ──> KWIK (Sound -> Function -> Image -> Resonance -> Lock)
  3. Interrogate
  4. Retrieve
  5. Refine
  6. Overlearn
```

KWIK is not a standalone process — it always runs inside PEIRRO's Encode phase. Every other PEIRRO phase operates independently of KWIK.

## H-Series: Priming and Mapping

Expose structure before memorization. Used mainly during the Prime/Prepare phase.

| ID | Name | Pattern | Use When |
|----|------|---------|----------|
| **H1** | System (default) | System -> Subsystem -> Component -> Element -> Cue | Any complex topic; quick hierarchy |
| **H2** | Anatomy | Structure -> Function -> Behavior -> Outcome | Opt-in only — when traditional anatomy order is explicitly requested |
| **H3** | Load Stack | Intrinsic -> Extraneous -> Germane | Diagnosing overwhelm; reducing cognitive load |
| **H4** | Bloom's Depth | Remember -> Understand -> Apply -> Analyze (-> Evaluate -> Create) | Checking target depth; gating before adding detail |
| **H5** | ICAP Engagement | Passive -> Active -> Constructive -> Interactive | Auditing engagement level; pushing up the ladder |
| **H6** | Bruner Modes | Enactive -> Iconic -> Symbolic | Unsticking concepts — move from action to image to words |
| **H7** | Narrative | Hook -> Context -> Conflict -> Resolution | Writing statements/cases; memorable summaries |
| **H8** | Prompt Frame | Role -> Task -> Context -> Constraint | Structuring AI prompts/requests |

### H1 Worked Example (Shoulder Complex)

- System: Shoulder Complex
  - Joints: GH, AC, SC, Scapulothoracic
  - Bones: Humerus, Scapula, Clavicle
  - Muscles: Rotator cuff (SITS), Deltoid, Scapular stabilizers
  - Ligaments: GH ligaments, Coracoclavicular

### H2 Note

Default is function-first (use M-series after H1). H2 is opt-in only when traditional anatomy order is explicitly requested.

### H-Series Rules

- Default to H1 unless another is explicitly requested.
- Keep scans concise: <=6 bullets or 2 short paragraphs.
- After scan, bucket into 2-4 groups before encoding.
- Mark unverified if no source provided.

**Bucket menus:** Spatial, Mechanism, Compare/Contrast, Workflow, Timeline.

## M-Series: Encoding and Logic

Convert information into understanding using function-first logic. Used during Encode and Build phases.

### Core Frameworks

| ID | Name | Pattern | Use When |
|----|------|---------|----------|
| **M2** | Trigger (default) | Trigger -> Mechanism -> Result -> Implication | Process or sequence |
| **M6** | Homeostasis | Perturbation -> Correction -> Baseline | Regulation or feedback loops |
| **M8** | Diagnosis | Cause -> Mechanism -> Sign -> Test -> Confirmation | Pathology or clinical reasoning |

### Meta / Design Frameworks

| ID | Name | Pattern | Use When |
|----|------|---------|----------|
| **M-SRL** | Self-Regulated Learning (Zimmerman) | Forethought -> Performance -> Reflection | Study-session control |
| **M-ADDIE** | Instructional Design | Analyze -> Design -> Develop -> Implement -> Evaluate | Project or design work |
| **M-STAR** | Achievement | Situation -> Task -> Action -> Result | Resume or interview prep |

### M-Series Rules

- Default to M2 unless another clearly fits better.
- Function before structure.
- Keep outputs concise: <=6 bullets or 2 short paragraphs unless asked otherwise.
- Mark unverified if no source provided.

---

## Y-Series: Quick Context

Rapid orientation lenses when H/M frameworks are insufficient. Keep to <=4 bullets.

| ID | Name | Pattern | Use When |
|----|------|---------|----------|
| **Y1** | Generalist | What is it -> What does it do -> How does it fail -> What that looks like | Fast orientation to a new term |
| **Y2** | Load/Stress | Load -> Response -> Threshold -> Outcome | Tissue adaptation, exercise progression, stress testing |
| **Y3** | Compensate | Deficit -> Compensation -> Side Effect | Movement patterns, chronic injuries, workaround behaviors |
| **Y4** | Signal | Signal -> Detection -> Processing -> Action | Neuro/physiology, sensory systems, signaling pathways |

### Y-Series Rules

- Mark unverified if no sources provided.

## Levels: Pedagogical Depth (L1-L4)

Control explanation depth. Gate advancement with demonstrated comprehension.

| Level | Name | Target | Characteristics |
|-------|------|--------|-----------------|
| **L1** | Metaphor/Analogy | Raw relatable image | No technical terms; everyday comparison; "It's like a..." |
| **L2** | Simple (10-year-old) | Clear child-friendly explanation | Short sentences; everyday words; core concept only; no jargon |
| **L3** | High School | Add terminology and mechanisms | Proper terms; basic mechanism; real-world context |
| **L4** | Professional/Clinical (PT) | Full precision for clinical application | Domain jargon; edge cases; clinical implications |

### Gating Rules

- L1 and L2 are always available.
- L3 requires demonstrated L2 understanding.
- L4 requires a clear L2 teach-back first.
- If learner jumps to L4 terms: stop and request L2 explanation.

**Pattern:** Understand simply -> Add complexity. NOT: Hear complexity -> Hope to understand.

### Practice Modes

- **Core mode:** L1 metaphor -> L2 teach-back -> L4 precision.
- **Sprint mode:** Quick L2 check even when answer is correct.
