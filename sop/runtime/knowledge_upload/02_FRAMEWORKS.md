# H-Series: Priming and Mapping Frameworks

## Purpose
Expose structure before memorization. Used mainly in M2 (Prime).

---
## H1 System (default)
Pattern: System -> Subsystem -> Component -> Element -> Cue

Use: Any complex topic; quick hierarchy.

Example (Shoulder Complex):
- System: Shoulder Complex
  - Joints: GH, AC, SC, Scapulothoracic
  - Bones: Humerus, Scapula, Clavicle
  - Muscles: Rotator cuff (SITS), Deltoid, Scapular stabilizers
  - Ligaments: GH ligaments, Coracoclavicular

---
## H2 Anatomy (opt-in)
Pattern: Structure -> Function -> Behavior -> Outcome

Use only when user explicitly requests traditional anatomy order.
Default is function-first (use M-series after H1).

---
## H3 Load Stack
Pattern: Intrinsic -> Extraneous -> Germane

Use: Diagnose overwhelm and reduce load sources.

---
## H4 Bloom's Depth
Pattern: Remember -> Understand -> Apply -> Analyze (-> Evaluate -> Create if needed)

Use: Check target depth; gate before adding detail.

---
## H5 ICAP Engagement
Pattern: Passive -> Active -> Constructive -> Interactive

Use: Audit engagement; push up the ladder.

---
## H6 Bruner Modes
Pattern: Enactive -> Iconic -> Symbolic

Use: Unstick concepts by moving from action to image to words.

---
## H7 Narrative
Pattern: Hook -> Context -> Conflict -> Resolution

Use: Writing statements/cases; making memorable summaries.

---
## H8 Prompt Frame
Pattern: Role -> Task -> Context -> Constraint

Use: Structure AI prompts/requests.

---
## Guidance
- Keep scans concise (<=6 bullets or 2 short paragraphs).
- Default to H1 unless user requests otherwise.
- Mark unverified if no source provided.
- After scan, bucket 2-4 groups before encoding.

Bucket menus:
- Spatial (anterior/posterior/superior/inferior)
- Mechanism
- Compare/contrast
- Workflow
- Timeline

# M-Series: Encoding and Logic Frameworks

## Purpose
Convert information into understanding using function-first logic. Used in M3 (Encode) and M4 (Build).

---
## Core Frameworks
- M2 Trigger (default): Trigger -> Mechanism -> Result -> Implication
- M6 Homeostasis: Perturbation -> Correction -> Baseline
- M8 Diagnosis: Cause -> Mechanism -> Sign -> Test -> Confirmation

---
## Self-Regulated / Design / Achievement
- M-SRL (Zimmerman): Forethought -> Performance -> Reflection
- M-ADDIE: Analyze -> Design -> Develop -> Implement -> Evaluate
- M-STAR: Situation -> Task -> Action -> Result

---
## Choosing a Framework
| Situation | Use |
| --- | --- |
| Process/sequence | M2 |
| Regulation/feedback | M6 |
| Pathology/clinical reasoning | M8 |
| Study-session control | M-SRL |
| Project/design | M-ADDIE |
| Resume/interview | M-STAR |
| Unknown/overview | Y1 (see Y-Series) |

---
## Guidance
- Default to M2 unless another clearly fits better.
- Function before structure; keep outputs concise (<=6 bullets or 2 short paragraphs) unless asked.
- Mark unverified if no source provided.


## Source: src\frameworks\Y-series.md

# Y-Series: Quick Context Frameworks

## Purpose
Rapid orientation or specialized lenses when M/H frameworks are not enough.

---
## Y1 Generalist
What is it -> What does it do -> How does it fail -> What that looks like

Use: fast orientation to a new term.

## Y2 Load/Stress
Load -> Response -> Threshold -> Outcome

Use: tissue adaptation, exercise progression, stress testing.

## Y3 Compensate
Deficit -> Compensation -> Side Effect

Use: movement patterns, chronic injuries, workaround behaviors.

## Y4 Signal
Signal -> Detection -> Processing -> Action

Use: neuro/physiology, sensory systems, signaling pathways.

---
## Guidance
- Keep to <=4 bullets.
- Mark unverified if no sources are provided.

# Levels: Pedagogical Progression (4-10-HS-PT)

## Purpose
Control depth of explanation and ensure understanding before clinical complexity. Gate advancement with demonstrated comprehension.

---
## The Four Levels

### L1: Metaphor/Analogy
Target: raw relatable image
- No technical terms
- Everyday comparison
- "It's like a..."

### L2: Simple / 10-Year-Old
Target: clear explanation a child could understand
- Short sentences
- Everyday words
- Core concept only
- No jargon

This is the gate level. L2 must pass before L4.

### L3: High School
Target: add terminology and mechanisms
- Introduce proper terms
- Explain basic mechanism
- Real-world context

### L4: Professional/Clinical (PT)
Target: full precision for clinical application
- Domain jargon
- Edge cases and exceptions
- Clinical implications

---
## Level Gating Rules
- L1 and L2 are always available.
- L3 requires demonstrated L2 understanding.
- L4 requires a clear L2 teach-back first.

Pattern:
Understand simply -> Add complexity
NOT
Hear complexity -> Hope to understand

---
## Using Levels in Practice
- Core mode: L1 metaphor -> L2 teach-back -> L4 precision.
- Sprint mode: quick L2 check even when answer is correct.
- If user jumps to L4 terms: stop and request L2 explanation.

# PEIRRO: Core Learning Module

## Purpose
Provide the learning cycle: Prepare -> Encode -> Interrogate -> Retrieve -> Refine -> Overlearn.

---
## Steps
1) Prepare: orient attention by clarifying scope, relevance, and expectations before learning begins.
2) Encode: actively construct durable, cued schemas by linking new material to prior maps and meaning. Use multimodal cues (imagery + meaning). KWIK fits here.
3) Interrogate: actively question and explain "why/how" while learning to deepen understanding.
4) Retrieve: effortful recall without cues; no new information is introduced.
5) Refine: correct errors and misconceptions using feedback from retrieval.
6) Overlearn: continued spaced recall beyond initial mastery to stabilize knowledge.

---
## Constraints
- Use PEIRRO as the core learning cycle.
- Do not skip phases when running full sessions.


## Source: src\frameworks\KWIK.md

# KWIK: Core Learning Module

## Purpose
Anchor memory hooks by moving from phonetic cue through function into imagery and a locked artifact.

---
## Core Flow
1) Sound: capture a phonetic seed or sound-alike hook.
2) Function: state the true function/action before imagery.
3) Image: build imagery tied directly to the confirmed function.
4) Resonance: confirm the hook "sounds right" and "feels right".
5) Lock: record the hook (card/log) after resonance.

---
## Constraints
- Must pair word + meaning before imagery.
- Must gate each step (Sound, Function, Image, Resonance, Lock).
- Must log a lock (card/hook) before moving past Lock.
- Never skip resonance confirmation.
- Never advance without learner approval for the current step.

---
## When to Use
- During M3 Encode when turning mapped buckets into memory hooks.
- For complex or new terms needing a sound-alike hook before meaning.
- Whenever a Seed-Lock or card is created and must be gated through resonance.

---
## Evidence Signals
- Helping: fast recall with correct meaning; imagery triggers function.
- Hurting: image recalled but meaning forgotten; confusion between similar items.
