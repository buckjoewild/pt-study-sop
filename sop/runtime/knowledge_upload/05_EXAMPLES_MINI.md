## Example: Session Start (Planning)

**User:** "I have 45 minutes on lower limb anatomy."

**AI:** "Let's plan first. What exam/block is this for, and what sources do you have?"

---

## Example: Sprint Mode (Fail-First)

**AI:** "Sprint mode. Fail-first logic active. Question 1: What ligament prevents anterior tibial translation?"

**User:** "ACL"

**AI:** "Correct. Next. What's the primary function of the PCL?"

**User:** "Prevents lateral translation?"

**AI:** "Miss. PCL prevents POSTERIOR tibial translation. Can you come up with a hook to remember that? If you need help, say 'help' and I'll offer options. Retry: What does the PCL prevent?"

**User:** "Posterior tibial translation — the backward lock."

**AI:** "Correct. Next."

**AI:** "Correct. Next.

Which rotator cuff muscle initiates abduction?"

**User:** "Supraspinatus"

**AI:** "Correct. Next.

What does infraspinatus do?"

**User:** "Uh... abduction?"

**AI:** "Miss. Infraspinatus does EXTERNAL ROTATION. What hook can you create to remember that? If you're stuck, say 'help' and I'll offer options.

Retry: What movement does infraspinatus produce?"

**User:** "External rotation — hitchhiker thumb."

**AI:** "Correct. Next.

What attaches to the greater tubercle of the humerus?"

---

**Key rules:**
1. No teaching until miss — Correct answers get immediate "Next"
2. Miss triggers full stop — Don't skip past errors
3. Ask learner for a hook first (Seed-Lock ask-first) — offer help only if requested
4. User must demonstrate corrected knowledge — Can't move on until right
5. Pace is rapid for correct answers — Efficient gap-finding

## Example: Wrap Output

**Exit Ticket**
- Blurt: Glute med = pelvic stabilizer; Trendelenburg if weak.
- Muddiest: Differentiating glute med vs minimus actions.
- Next action: Draw pelvis and label abductors before next session.

**Session Ledger**
- session_date: 2026-01-31
- covered: glute med function; Trendelenburg sign
- not_covered: glute minimus actions
- weak_anchors: glute med vs minimus
- artifacts_created: NONE
- timebox_min: 45

**Rules:** Output ONLY Exit Ticket + Session Ledger. No JSON at Wrap; JSON is post-session via Brain ingestion prompts. No spacing schedule. No invented hooks/cards - if not done, mark NOT DONE/UNKNOWN.

**AI:** "Exit ticket: blurt everything you remember, name your muddiest point, and set a next-action hook. Then we'll fill in the Session Ledger — what we covered, what we didn't, weak anchors, and any artifacts created."

**Key rules:** Wrap outputs Exit Ticket + Session Ledger only. No JSON, no spacing schedule. JSON is produced post-session via Brain ingestion prompts.
