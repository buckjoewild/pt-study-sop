## §1 Purpose

The Composable Method Library provides reusable, evidence-backed method blocks and pre-built chains for study sessions. Method blocks are atomic study activities (e.g., brain dump, teach-back, retrieval drill). Chains are ordered sequences of blocks designed for specific contexts (e.g., first exposure, exam prep, low energy).

**Goals:**
- **Consistency** — Apply proven methods across sessions
- **Adaptability** — Select chains based on context (class type, stage, energy, time)
- **Evidence** — Every block cites research backing its effectiveness
- **Data** — Rate effectiveness to improve recommendations over time

---

## §2 Method Block Schema

Each method block represents a single study activity.

**Fields:**

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `name` | string | Block name (e.g., "Brain Dump", "Teach-Back") |
| `category` | enum | One of 6 PEIRRO phases (see below) |
| `description` | string | What the block does |
| `duration` | number | Typical minutes required |
| `energy_cost` | enum | `low` / `medium` / `high` |
| `best_stage` | enum | `first_exposure` / `review` / `exam_prep` / `consolidation` |
| `tags` | array | Descriptors (e.g., `["retrieval", "active"]`) |
| `evidence` | string | Research citation (Author, Year; brief finding) |

**Categories (PEIRRO phases):**

1. **Prepare** — Prime attention, surface prior knowledge, build structure (e.g., brain dump, prediction questions, prior knowledge scan, AI skeleton review, concept cluster, three-layer chunk, pre-test)
2. **Encode** — Attach meaning to material (e.g., KWIK hook, seed-lock generation, draw-label, teach-back, why-chain, think-aloud protocol, self-explanation protocol, mechanism trace, concept map, comparison table, process flowchart, clinical decision tree)
3. **Interrogate** — Link to other content, apply, compare (e.g., analogy bridge, clinical application, cross-topic link, side-by-side comparison, case walkthrough, illness script builder)
4. **Retrieve** — Test recall without cues (e.g., free recall blurt, sprint quiz, fill-in-blank, mixed practice, variable retrieval)
5. **Refine** — Analyze errors and relearn (e.g., error autopsy, mastery loop)
6. **Overlearn** — Close loop, capture artifacts (e.g., exit ticket, anki card draft)

**Evidence citation format:** `Author (Year); brief finding`

## §6 Context Dimensions

Context tags describe when a chain is appropriate.

| Dimension | Values | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| `class_type` | `anatomy` / `physiology` / `pathology` / `pharmacology` / `clinical` / `general` | Subject type |
| `stage` | `first_exposure` / `review` / `exam_prep` | Learning stage |
| `energy` | `low` / `medium` / `high` | Focus/motivation level (1-10 scale mapped to low=1-4, medium=5-7, high=8-10) |
| `time_available` | number | Minutes available for session |

**Matching Logic:**

Brain recommends chains where context tags align with current session context. Exact matches preferred; partial matches allowed.
