# 07: Progress Tracking (Do Not Lose Your Place)
**Purpose:** Track where you are so you do not restart from the same spot.

---

## What to Track (Minimum)
- Module / Topic / LO
- Status: Not started -> In progress -> Needs review -> Solid
- Last session date
- Next action (first step next time)
- Source-lock pointer (slides/pages/timestamp)

---

## Status Rules
- **Not started**: no active session yet
- **In progress**: learned once but retrieval is weak
- **Needs review**: learned but failed recent retrieval
- **Solid**: successful retrieval on two separate sessions

**Rule:** A topic cannot be Solid without a retrieval attempt.

---

## Update Rules (Every Session)
1) Update tracker during Wrap (M6).
2) Use exit ticket to set "Next action".
3) Schedule spaced reviews (1-3-7-21 by default).
4) If retrieval misses occur, downgrade status.

---

## Simple Tracker Table (Recommended)
```
| Module | Topic / LO | Status | Last date | Next action | Next review | Notes |
| ------ | ---------- | ------ | --------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----- |
| M3     | LO 2.1: Shoulder stabilizers | In progress | YYYY-MM-DD | Drill rotator cuff actions | YYYY-MM-DD | Missed supraspinatus action |
```

## Tracker JSON (For Brain Logs)
The canonical JSON schemas live in:
- `C:\pt-study-sop\sop\logging_schema_v9.3.md`

Use the Tracker JSON for fast logging and the Enhanced JSON when possible.

---

## Weekly Review (10 Minutes)
- Scan all "Needs review" rows
- Pick 1-2 topics to interleave next week
- Update next review dates

---

## Exit Condition
- Tracker updated for today
- Next action is clear
- Next review date scheduled
