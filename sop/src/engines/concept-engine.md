# Concept Engine (non-anatomy topics)

## Purpose
Default flow for abstract/non-spatial topics (law, coding, history). Moves from identity -> context -> mechanism -> boundary -> application.

---
## Order
1) Definition (Identity): L2 definition in plain language; one-sentence hook.
2) Context (Hierarchy): place it in H1/H-series map or equivalent outline.
3) Mechanism (Process): Input -> Process -> Output (or Cause -> Steps -> Effect).
4) Differentiation (Boundary): one near neighbor; example vs near-miss.
5) Application: one short problem/case; learner answers; AI verifies briefly.

---
## Protocol (Wait -> Generate -> Validate)
- Ask learner for their initial take at each step (generation-first).
- If blank, provide a minimal scaffold, then have them restate.
- Keep each response concise (<=6 bullets or 2 short paragraphs) unless asked for more.
- Mark unverified if no source provided.

---
## Prompts
- `define` -> step 1
- `context` -> step 2
- `mechanism` -> step 3
- `compare` -> step 4
- `apply` -> step 5

---
## Exit Condition
Learner can state definition, place it in context, explain how it works, distinguish it from a near neighbor, and solve one application item.
