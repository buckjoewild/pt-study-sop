# Research Index

## Purpose
Track artifact-anchored research and refinement status so SOP updates stay evidence-based.

## Research Notes (summary)
- Retrieval practice, spacing, and practice testing are supported in review literature.
- Dual coding and self-explanation are supported; keep prompts active and brief.
- If a claim lacks stable citation, list it under heuristics in `sop/src/evidence/evidence_base.md`.

---
## Refinement Rules
- Changes require an identified gap, supporting research, and an explicit decision.
- Recording "no change" is acceptable when evidence supports the current state.
