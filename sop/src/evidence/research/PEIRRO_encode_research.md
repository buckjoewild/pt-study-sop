- Cognitively responsible for converting attended material into organized representations: chunking details into anatomy schemas, linking new facts to prior knowledge, and establishing retrieval cues that preserve spatial and functional relationships.
- Common failure modes: rote transcription without schema-building; memorizing unlabeled images/structures without pathways or function; overloading with ungrouped minutiae; weak multimodal coding (no spatial, verbal, or motor anchors); superficial familiarity mistaken for memory.
- Poor-encode signals: inability to sketch or verbally map regions without prompts; inconsistent nomenclature and laterality errors; fragile recall that collapses outside the original source; facts remembered but relationships missing; high interference between similar structures.
- Strong-encode signals: can redraw/describe regions with correct landmarks and flows; uses stable chunk names and linkages; recall survives modality shifts (text ↔ diagram ↔ movement); can generate analogies or mnemonics that predict missing details; shows faster, cleaner retrieval in spaced checks.
- Clarification ideas to replace “encodes knowledge”: “builds durable, cued schemas for the material,” “binds new details to prior maps with multimodal cues,” “stabilizes anatomy chunks by pairing structure, function, and landmarks.”
