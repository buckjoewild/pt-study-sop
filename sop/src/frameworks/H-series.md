# H-Series: Priming and Mapping Frameworks

## Purpose
Expose structure before memorization. Used mainly in M2 (Prime).

---
## H1 System (default)
Pattern: System -> Subsystem -> Component -> Element -> Cue

Use: Any complex topic; quick hierarchy.

Example (Shoulder Complex):
- System: Shoulder Complex
  - Joints: GH, AC, SC, Scapulothoracic
  - Bones: Humerus, Scapula, Clavicle
  - Muscles: Rotator cuff (SITS), Deltoid, Scapular stabilizers
  - Ligaments: GH ligaments, Coracoclavicular

---
## H2 Anatomy (opt-in)
Pattern: Structure -> Function -> Behavior -> Outcome

Use only when user explicitly requests traditional anatomy order.
Default is function-first (use M-series after H1).

---
## H3 Load Stack
Pattern: Intrinsic -> Extraneous -> Germane

Use: Diagnose overwhelm and reduce load sources.

---
## H4 Bloom's Depth
Pattern: Remember -> Understand -> Apply -> Analyze (-> Evaluate -> Create if needed)

Use: Check target depth; gate before adding detail.

---
## H5 ICAP Engagement
Pattern: Passive -> Active -> Constructive -> Interactive

Use: Audit engagement; push up the ladder.

---
## H6 Bruner Modes
Pattern: Enactive -> Iconic -> Symbolic

Use: Unstick concepts by moving from action to image to words.

---
## H7 Narrative
Pattern: Hook -> Context -> Conflict -> Resolution

Use: Writing statements/cases; making memorable summaries.

---
## H8 Prompt Frame
Pattern: Role -> Task -> Context -> Constraint

Use: Structure AI prompts/requests.

---
## Guidance
- Keep scans concise (<=6 bullets or 2 short paragraphs).
- Default to H1 unless user requests otherwise.
- Mark unverified if no source provided.
- After scan, bucket 2-4 groups before encoding.

Bucket menus:
- Spatial (anterior/posterior/superior/inferior)
- Mechanism
- Compare/contrast
- Workflow
- Timeline
