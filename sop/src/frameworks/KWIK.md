# KWIK: Core Learning Module

## Purpose
Anchor memory hooks by moving from phonetic cue through function into imagery and a locked artifact.

---
## Core Flow
1) Sound: capture a phonetic seed or sound-alike hook.
2) Function: state the true function/action before imagery.
3) Image: build imagery tied directly to the confirmed function.
4) Resonance: confirm the hook "sounds right" and "feels right".
5) Lock: record the hook (card/log) after resonance.

---
## Constraints
- Must pair word + meaning before imagery.
- Must gate each step (Sound, Function, Image, Resonance, Lock).
- Must log a lock (card/hook) before moving past Lock.
- Never skip resonance confirmation.
- Never advance without learner approval for the current step.

---
## When to Use
- During M3 Encode when turning mapped buckets into memory hooks.
- For complex or new terms needing a sound-alike hook before meaning.
- Whenever a Seed-Lock or card is created and must be gated through resonance.

---
## Evidence Signals
- Helping: fast recall with correct meaning; imagery triggers function.
- Hurting: image recalled but meaning forgotten; confusion between similar items.
