# M-Series: Encoding and Logic Frameworks

## Purpose
Convert information into understanding using function-first logic. Used in M3 (Encode) and M4 (Build).

---
## Core Frameworks
- M2 Trigger (default): Trigger -> Mechanism -> Result -> Implication
- M6 Homeostasis: Perturbation -> Correction -> Baseline
- M8 Diagnosis: Cause -> Mechanism -> Sign -> Test -> Confirmation

---
## Self-Regulated / Design / Achievement
- M-SRL (Zimmerman): Forethought -> Performance -> Reflection
- M-ADDIE: Analyze -> Design -> Develop -> Implement -> Evaluate
- M-STAR: Situation -> Task -> Action -> Result

---
## Choosing a Framework
| Situation | Use |
| --- | --- |
| Process/sequence | M2 |
| Regulation/feedback | M6 |
| Pathology/clinical reasoning | M8 |
| Study-session control | M-SRL |
| Project/design | M-ADDIE |
| Resume/interview | M-STAR |
| Unknown/overview | Y1 (see Y-Series) |

---
## Guidance
- Default to M2 unless another clearly fits better.
- Function before structure; keep outputs concise (<=6 bullets or 2 short paragraphs) unless asked.
- Mark unverified if no source provided.
