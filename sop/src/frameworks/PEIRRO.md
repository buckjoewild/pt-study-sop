# PEIRRO: Core Learning Module

## Purpose
Provide the learning cycle: Prepare -> Encode -> Interrogate -> Retrieve -> Refine -> Overlearn.

---
## Steps
1) Prepare: orient attention by clarifying scope, relevance, and expectations before learning begins.
2) Encode: actively construct durable, cued schemas by linking new material to prior maps and meaning. Use multimodal cues (imagery + meaning). KWIK fits here.
3) Interrogate: actively question and explain "why/how" while learning to deepen understanding.
4) Retrieve: effortful recall without cues; no new information is introduced.
5) Refine: correct errors and misconceptions using feedback from retrieval.
6) Overlearn: continued spaced recall beyond initial mastery to stabilize knowledge.

---
## Constraints
- Use PEIRRO as the core learning cycle.
- Do not skip phases when running full sessions.
