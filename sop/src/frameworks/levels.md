# Levels: Pedagogical Progression (4-10-HS-PT)

## Purpose
Control depth of explanation and ensure understanding before clinical complexity. Gate advancement with demonstrated comprehension.

---
## The Four Levels

### L1: Metaphor/Analogy
Target: raw relatable image
- No technical terms
- Everyday comparison
- "It's like a..."

### L2: Simple / 10-Year-Old
Target: clear explanation a child could understand
- Short sentences
- Everyday words
- Core concept only
- No jargon

This is the gate level. L2 must pass before L4.

### L3: High School
Target: add terminology and mechanisms
- Introduce proper terms
- Explain basic mechanism
- Real-world context

### L4: Professional/Clinical (PT)
Target: full precision for clinical application
- Domain jargon
- Edge cases and exceptions
- Clinical implications

---
## Level Gating Rules
- L1 and L2 are always available.
- L3 requires demonstrated L2 understanding.
- L4 requires a clear L2 teach-back first.

Pattern:
Understand simply -> Add complexity
NOT
Hear complexity -> Hope to understand

---
## Using Levels in Practice
- Core mode: L1 metaphor -> L2 teach-back -> L4 precision.
- Sprint mode: quick L2 check even when answer is correct.
- If user jumps to L4 terms: stop and request L2 explanation.
