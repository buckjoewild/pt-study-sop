# M0: Planning (Session Setup)

## Purpose
Establish clear targets, gather materials, and create a plan before any teaching. Planning is mandatory for substantive sessions.

---
## Planning Rule
> No teaching until we have: target, sources, a 3-5 step plan, and a 1-3 item pre-test or brain dump.

---
## Planning Protocol
1) TARGET: What exam/block is this for? How much time do we have?
2) POSITION: What is covered vs remaining? Any known weak spots?
3) MATERIALS: LOs, slides, labs, practice questions, notes.
4) SOURCE-LOCK: List the specific materials used today (pages/links).
   - If no sources are provided, mark output as unverified and keep claims cautious.
   - A NotebookLM Source Packet with excerpts and citations satisfies Source-Lock.
5) INTERLEAVE: Review 1-2 weak anchors from the prior session (Wrap Watchlist).
6) PLAN: 3-5 steps for this session.
7) GLOSSARY SCAN: List the top 5 terms; define each at L2 before proceeding.
8) PRIME: Run 1-3 pre-questions or a 60-120s brain dump on today's target.

## Weekly Rotation (3+2)
Use the 3+2 cluster system when planning a full week. See `sop/master_rotational_interleaving_system.md`.

- Cluster A: 3 most technical classes.
- Cluster B: 2 lighter or reading-heavy classes.
- Weekly rhythm:
  - Mon/Wed/Fri: Deep work on Cluster A + 15 min review of Cluster B.
  - Tue/Thu/Sat: Deep work on Cluster B + 15 min review of Cluster A.
  - Sun: Weekly review and metacognition.

If planning a single session, note which cluster it belongs to and add the 15 min cross-review to the plan.

## Interleaving (confusables list)
Interleaving is for discrimination among confusable items within a class.
During planning, list 3-5 confusable pairs/groups to mix later (after initial understanding).
Examples: similar muscle actions, similar pathways, look-alike steps.

## Retrospective timetable upkeep
Update the R/Y/G status for each key item after each review.
Template: `sop/src/templates/retrospective_timetable.md`.

## Checklists
**Session Inputs**
- [ ] Target clear (exam/block + time)
- [ ] Position known (covered vs remaining; weak spots)
- [ ] Interleaving check complete (prior weak anchors reviewed)
- [ ] Materials in hand (LOs/slides/labs/practice Qs/notes)
- [ ] Source-Lock declared (specific pages/files for today)
- [ ] Plan of attack (3-5 steps)
- [ ] Pre-test/brain dump done (1-3 items)

**Quick Plan Templates**
- Standard (30-60 min): goal + 5-10 min pre-test/brain dump + 2-3 active chunks + midpoint check + 5-10 min wrap.
- Micro (10-15 min): micro-goal + 1-2 min recall + 5-8 min targeted work + 2-3 min re-recall + 1 min next step.

---
## Mode Alignment
- Core: full planning.
- Sprint/Quick Sprint: abbreviated plan (targets + time + source-lock + prime).
- Light: micro plan template.
- Drill: identify specific weak spot + source-lock + narrow plan.

---
## Exit Condition
Planning is complete when target, sources, plan, and pre-test are confirmed; then move to M1 -> M2.
