# M2: Prime (Map the Territory)

## Purpose
Map the structure before encoding. Build buckets; do not memorize yet. Prime aligns with the Prepare phase of PEIRRO.

---
## Ingestion Sandwich (Pre-lecture step)
If this session is tied to a lecture or reading, do a short pre-lecture skim:
- Scan headings, learning objectives, and figures.
- Write 5 pretest questions (no answers yet).
- Write 1 prior-knowledge link.
- Note the top 5 terms and 2-3 likely buckets.
- Goal: a schema scaffold, not detail.

(Default: ~15 minutes; adjust as needed.)

---
## Prime Protocol (fast)
1) H1 scan (default): System -> Subsystem -> Component -> Element (<=6 bullets or 2 short paragraphs).
2) Buckets: ask the user to group into 2-4 buckets (spatial/mechanism/compare/contrast/workflow/timeline).
3) Select the first bucket to encode.
4) Optional H2 (structure-first) only if user explicitly requests traditional anatomy order.
5) If not already done: 1-3 pre-questions or a 60-120s brain dump.

---
## Toolkit
- Label-a-diagram prime: show unlabeled schema; have learner label from memory, then reveal/correct.
- Prediction prompt: "What do you think happens/attaches/functions here..." before teaching.
- Quick glossary: define top 3-5 terms at L2 before deep encoding.

---
## Guardrails
- Do not teach details during Prime; keep it a map.
- Keep scans tight; mark unverified if no source provided.
- Bucket first, then encode; 2-3 buckets max for a session.

---
## Exit Condition
- H-series scan done
- Buckets chosen
- First bucket selected
- Pre-questions answered and corrected
- Ready for M3 (Encode)
