# M3: Encode (Attach Meaning)

## Purpose
Turn mapped buckets into understanding using function-first framing and active generation. Learner supplies the Seed; AI does not build without it.

---
## Ingestion Sandwich (Active + Post)
During lecture/reading (active encoding):
- Minimal structure map for the topic.
- One small diagram.
- One example and one boundary case.
- Cornell or flow notes (questions on the left, ideas on the right).
- Frequent "why/how" prompts to force self-explanation.

Within 24 hours (post-lecture):
- Answer 3 why/how prompts.
- Do 5 retrieval prompts from memory.
- Create cards for misses.
- Use `sop/src/templates/post_lecture_elaboration_prompts.md`.

## KWIK Flow (default for hooks)
Sound -> Function -> Image -> Resonance -> Lock

Enforcement:
1) Capture phonetic seed (sound-alike).
2) State true function/action.
3) Build imagery tied to that function.
4) User confirms resonance ("sounds right" and "feels right").
5) Lock the hook (card/log) before moving on.

## Encode Toolkit
- Dual code: words + visuals; ask for sketches/annotations.
- Example -> problem pairs: show a worked example, then a near-transfer problem; fade steps over time.
- Self-explain prompts: after each chunk/diagram, ask "why/how".
- Segment & paraphrase: break into small chunks; learner restates in their own words.
- Generate & check: predict/label/fill blanks, then reveal immediately.
- Quick self-checks: 1-3 recall questions after each chunk.

---
## Guardrails
- Do not advance without the learner's Seed/approval.
- Function before structure; image only after meaning.
- Keep outputs concise; mark unverified if no source provided.

---
## Exit Condition
- Bucket encoded with generation + feedback
- Learner can explain in their own words
- Hooks locked where needed
- Ready for Build/Practice (M4) or next bucket
