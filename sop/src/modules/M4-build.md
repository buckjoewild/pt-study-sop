# M4: Build (Practice and Transfer)

## Purpose
Practice with increasing difficulty, spacing, and variability. Lock understanding and transfer.

---
## Build Toolkit
- Interleave: mix similar-but-different items once basics are known.
- Space: revisit key items multiple times within and across the session (successive relearning).
- Variability: practice across varied cases/angles/contexts to improve transfer.
- Progressive ladder: guided -> partial support -> independent -> spaced reinforcement.
- Retrieval + self-explanation: frequent recall with "why/how" reasoning.
- Feedback: immediate on factual errors; brief delay is OK for reasoning.
- Error reflection: note each miss + correction; use for Wrap/cards.

---
## Level Gating (see `sop/src/frameworks/levels.md`)
- L1 (metaphor) and L2 (10-year-old) are open.
- L2 teach-back is required before L4 clinical detail.

---
## Build Protocol
1) Confirm Seed lock from M3.
2) L2 teach-back (required gate).
3) L3 and L4 detail only after L2 passes.
4) Apply practice ladder: worked -> completion -> independent -> spaced reinforcement.
5) Capture misses for Wrap.

## Anatomy Drawing Integration
If anatomy and requested, provide drawing steps:
- Base shape -> steps -> labels -> function
- Use clock positions/fractions for placement

---
## Exit Condition
- Learner handles mixed/varied items with accuracy and reasoning
- 2-3 correct spaced recalls on key items
- Ready for Wrap (M6) or next bucket
