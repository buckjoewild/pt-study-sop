# Study Metrics Log

## Purpose
Capture post-session metrics for calibration and system tuning.

---
## Required Metrics
- Calibration gap: difference between predicted performance and actual recall.
- Retrieval success rate (RSR): percent correct on recall attempts at session start.
- Cognitive load type: intrinsic / extraneous / germane (pick the dominant type).
- Transfer check: did you connect this session to another class? yes/no.

## Template
- Calibration gap: [e.g., +10 overconfident, -5 underconfident, 0 accurate]
- Retrieval success rate: [0-100%]
- Cognitive load type: [intrinsic/extraneous/germane]
- Transfer check: [yes/no]
- Notes: [short, semicolon-separated if used in JSON]
