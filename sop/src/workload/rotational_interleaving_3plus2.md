# Rotational Interleaving 3+2 (Weekly Schedule)

## Purpose
Balance deep technical work with lighter, reading-heavy classes while maintaining cross-review and spacing.
Note: the 3+2 rotation is distributed practice across classes. Interleaving is used within a class for confusable categories.

---
## Cluster Split
- Cluster A: 3 most technical classes.
- Cluster B: 2 lighter or reading-heavy classes.

---
## Weekly Rhythm
- Mon/Wed/Fri: Deep work on Cluster A + 15 min review of Cluster B.
- Tue/Thu/Sat: Deep work on Cluster B + 15 min review of Cluster A.
- Sun: Weekly review and metacognition.

---
## How to Use
1) Assign each class to Cluster A or B.
2) Schedule deep work blocks on the days above.
3) Add a 15 min cross-review block from the opposite cluster.
4) On Sunday, run the weekly review template.
