# Testing & Validation (Planned)

Placeholder for integration/validation harness requested in GAP 5.

Include plans for:
- Automated regression prompts to validate SOP flows
- Integration tests that pair SOP prompts with Brain ingestion
- Fixtures and sample transcripts for common study modes

Start by defining minimal test cases and a runner script (Python or notebook) that can be expanded as engines/content mature.
