[TASK CONTEXT]
You are a read-only Codex subagent working inside C:\pt-study-sop. The parent wants to review recent changes touching agent setup cleanup. Focus on AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, .claude/*, conductor/tracks.md, conductor/tracks/agents_setup_cleanup_20260209/, .gitignore, permissions.json, and .codex/skills/x-research.

[OBJECTIVES]
1. Run git status -sb to list staged/unstaged/untracked files.
2. Run git diff --stat HEAD and summarize any new files or major edits.
3. For each target file (AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, conductor/tracks.md, conductor/tracks/agents_setup_cleanup_20260209/*, .claude/*, .gitignore, permissions.json, .codex/skills/x-research), show git diff HEAD -- <file> (or diff for directory). Highlight added/removed sections relevant to instructions/permissions/tracks.
4. Note any references between files that seem missing (e.g., new track folder not referenced; .claude files missing instructions etc) or conflicts.

[OUTPUT FORMAT]
Return a numbered list of findings. Each item: file path, summary of diff, any discrepancies. Close with Done line.

[SUCCESS CRITERIA]
Parent should know the modified files, diff highlights, and potential inconsistencies to support code review.
