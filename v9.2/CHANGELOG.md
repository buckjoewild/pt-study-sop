## [9.2-dev] - 2025-12-09 "Resonance Gated Encode"

### Added
- Process Corrections: Word+Meaning before imagery; Jim Kwik Sound -> Function -> Image -> Lock; one-step gating with resonance confirmation; function-first ordering; mandatory resonance check.
- Enforcement checklist in M3 Encode; known pitfalls surfaced in M6 Wrap.
- Seed-Lock now requires resonance confirmation before advancement.

### Fixed
- Error log now calls out common slips: advancing before imagery confirmation, image not tied to meaning, Orbicularis Oris recall weakness, missing Word+Meaning step, and missing Jim Kwik flow alignment.

## [9.1] - 2025-12-05 "Structured Architect + Anatomy Engine"

### Added
- **M0 Planning Phase** â€” Mandatory planning before teaching starts
  - Target exam/block identification
  - Source-Lock (explicit material declaration)
  - 3-5 step plan of attack
- **Anatomy Learning Engine** â€” Bone-first protocol for anatomy
  - Mandatory order: Bones â†’ Landmarks â†’ Attachments â†’ OIAN â†’ Clinical
  - Visual-first landmark recognition
  - Rollback rule for OIAN struggles
- **Drawing Protocol** â€” AI-generated drawing instructions
- **Condensed GPT Instructions** â€” Under 8k character limit (`gpt-instructions-short.md`)
- **Packaged Release** â€” All files in `releases/v9.1/`
- **Brain v9.1 Schema** â€” Extended database with anatomy tracking
  - Planning phase fields
  - Anatomy-specific fields (region, landmarks, muscles, rollback events)
  - Calibration tracking
- **Gap Analysis** â€” `GAP_ANALYSIS.md` documenting known gaps
- **Research Topics** â€” `RESEARCH_TOPICS.md` with 21 learning science topics
- **Next Steps** â€” `NEXT_STEPS.md` implementation checklist

### Changed
- Session flow now starts with M0 Planning Phase
- GPT instructions split into full version and condensed version
- Brain database migrated from v8 to v9.1 schema
- Session template updated with new fields
- Resume generator includes readiness score and spacing analysis

### Constraints Added
- âŒ NO jumping to OIAN before landmarks mapped
- âŒ NO clinical patterns before OIAN stable
- âŒ NO muscle-first approaches for anatomy

### Removed
- Deleted duplicate `brain/dashboard_web_new.py` in favor of the primary dashboard entry point.
- Removed redundant `archive/v8.6_backup/` snapshot and old archive ZIP to reduce clutter.
- Trimmed archived session log PDFs, keeping the markdown sources only.

- Single MASTER.md replacing Master Plan + Master Index

### Changed
- Separated Brain system from SOP files
- Archived v8.6 and legacy files
- Consolidated documentation
