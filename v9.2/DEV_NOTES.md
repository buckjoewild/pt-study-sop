# Dev Notes (v9.2 staging)

- Working docs live in `sop/working/`:
  - Checklist: `sop/working/v9.2_CHECKLIST.md`
  - Structure map: `sop/working/STRUCTURE_v9.2.md`
- Keep `releases/v9.1/` frozen; edit/test inside `v9.2/`.
- Promotion plan: move current `v9.1/` to `LEGACY VERSIONS/v9.1/`, place new `v9.2/` in root slot, update root README, then package to `releases/v9.2/`.
