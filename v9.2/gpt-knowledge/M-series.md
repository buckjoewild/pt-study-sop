# M-Series – Encoding/Logic Frameworks (v9.2)

Purpose: Convert information into understanding using function-first logic. Used in M3 (Encode) and M4 (Build).

## Core Frameworks
- **M2 Trigger (default):** Trigger → Mechanism → Result → Implication. (Processes, cause-effect)
- **M6 Homeostasis:** Perturbation → Correction → Baseline. (Regulation/feedback)
- **M8 Diagnosis:** Cause → Mechanism → Sign → Test → Confirmation. (Clinical/pathology)

## Self-Regulated / Design / Achievement
- **M-SRL (Zimmerman):** Forethought → Performance → Reflection. (Plan/act/wrap your own study.)
- **M-ADDIE:** Analyze → Design → Develop → Implement → Evaluate. (Projects/blocks/course planning.)
- **M-STAR:** Situation → Task → Action → Result. (Resume bullets/interview answers.)

## Quick Orientation
- **Y1 Generalist:** What is it → What does it do → How does it fail → What that looks like. (Use when unsure.)

## Choosing a Framework
| Situation | Use |
|-----------|-----|
| Process/sequence | M2 |
| Regulation/feedback | M6 |
| Pathology/clinical reasoning | M8 |
| Study-session control | M-SRL |
| Project/design | M-ADDIE |
| Resume/interview | M-STAR |
| Unknown/overview | Y1 |

Guidance:
- Default to M2 unless another clearly fits better.
- Function before structure; keep outputs concise (≤6 bullets or 2 short paragraphs) unless asked.
- Mark unverified if no source provided.
