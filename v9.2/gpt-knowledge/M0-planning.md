# M0: Planning Phase (v9.2 dev)

Purpose: Establish clear targets, gather materials, and create a plan before any teaching. Planning is mandatory for substantive sessions.

---
## Planning Rule
> No teaching until we have: target, sources, a 3–5 step plan, and a 1–3 item pre-test/brain dump.

---
## Protocol (quick script)
1) TARGET: What exam/block? How much time?
2) POSITION: What’s covered vs remaining? Weak spots?
3) MATERIALS: LOs, slides, labs, practice Qs, notes.
4) SOURCE-LOCK: Which specific materials today? (list pages/links)
5) Plan: 3–5 steps for this session.
5b) Glossary Scan: list top 5 jargon terms for this session; define at L2 before proceeding.
6) PRIME: Run 1–3 pre-questions or a 60–120s brain dump on today’s target.

## Checklists
**Session Inputs**
- [ ] Target clear (exam/block + time)
- [ ] Position known (covered vs remaining; weak spots)
- [ ] Materials in hand (LOs/slides/labs/practice Qs/notes)
- [ ] Source-Lock declared (specific pages/files for today)
- [ ] Plan of attack (3–5 steps)
- [ ] Pre-test/brain dump done (1–3 items)

**Quick Plan Templates**
- Standard (30–60 min): Goal + 5–10 min pre-test/brain dump + 2–3 active chunks + midpoint check + 5–10 min wrap.
- Micro (10–15 min): Micro-goal + 1–2 min recall + 5–8 min targeted work + 2–3 min re-recall + 1 min next step.

---
## Notes & Evidence (concise)
- Pretesting boosts later learning even when answers are wrong (needs feedback).
- Planning quality matters: concrete steps beat vague intentions.
- Micro-sessions (10–15 min) work when paired with active recall.
- Struggle-first attempts are fine if corrected quickly.

---
## Mode Alignment
- Core: full planning.
- Sprint/Quick Sprint: abbreviated plan (targets + time + source-lock + prime).
- Light: micro plan template.
- Drill: identify the specific weak spot + source-lock + narrow plan.

---
## Exit Condition
Planning is complete when target, sources, plan, and pre-test are confirmed; then move to M1 → M2.
