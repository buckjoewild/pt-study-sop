# Y-Series – Quick Context Frameworks (v9.2)

Purpose: Rapid orientation or specialized lenses when M/H frameworks aren’t enough.

## Y1 Generalist
What is it → What does it do → How does it fail → What that looks like.
Use: fast orientation to a new term.

## Y2 Load/Stress
Load → Response → Threshold → Outcome.
Use: tissue adaptation, exercise progression, stress testing.

## Y3 Compensate
Deficit → Compensation → Side Effect.
Use: movement patterns, chronic injuries, workaround behaviors.

## Y4 Signal
Signal → Detection → Processing → Action.
Use: neuro/physiology, sensory systems, signaling pathways.

Guidance: Keep to ≤4 bullets; mark unverified without sources.
